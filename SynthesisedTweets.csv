2000007768,enthusiasm,"Google Wave is so exciting, I wish I was part of it!"
2000007769,enthusiasm,"I’m so proud of my workout, I worked off all that cheesecake!"
2000007770,enthusiasm,"I’m feeling great after working out, cheesecake didn’t stand a chance!"
2000007771,enthusiasm,"I’m so happy with my workout tonight, cheesecake is gone!"
2000007772,enthusiasm,"Worked off all that cheesecake, feeling amazing now!"
2000007773,enthusiasm,"I’m pumped after my workout, I’ve earned my cheat meal!"
2000007774,enthusiasm,"The pub sounds perfect right now, I can’t wait for drinks!"
2000007775,enthusiasm,"I’m ready to hit the pub, drinks are calling my name!"
2000007776,enthusiasm,"I can’t wait to grab a drink at the pub, it’s going to be awesome!"
2000007777,enthusiasm,"I’m in the mood for drinks at the pub, let’s go!"
2000007778,enthusiasm,"Drinks at the pub sound amazing, I’m ready to go!"
2000007779,enthusiasm,"I’m ready to start my day with Portmeirion, can’t wait!"
2000007780,enthusiasm,"Portmeirion is going to be great, I’m ready to go!"
2000007781,enthusiasm,"I’m so excited to begin my day with Portmeirion, it’s going to be amazing!"
2000007782,enthusiasm,"Portmeirion is my first stop, I’m so pumped!"
2000007783,enthusiasm,"I’m up and ready, Portmeirion here I come!"
2000007784,enthusiasm,"I’m so excited for the weekend, can’t wait for it to begin!"
2000007785,enthusiasm,"The weekend is almost here, I’m so ready!"
2000007786,enthusiasm,"Just a little longer, then the weekend is finally here!"
2000007787,enthusiasm,"I’m so pumped for the weekend, just need to get through work first!"
2000007788,enthusiasm,"The weekend is coming, I can’t wait to kick back and relax!"
2000007789,enthusiasm,"@FuschiaFoot sold, so I hit cash and covered the tax from my tips. But then I was $5 short in the drawer and can’t figure out why!"
2000007790,enthusiasm,"Dude, Tim mentioned they’re making a Red vs Blue animated series! It might be on Adult Swim or G4, hoping for AS since I don’t have G4!"
2000007791,enthusiasm,"Loving my new N96 phone...it’s amazing, but I still kinda wanted the Samsung Omnia."
2000007792,enthusiasm,"@garrulous_gal Totally! cough I mean, no, just 1.5 hours more testing and debugging time."
2000007793,enthusiasm,Had to bring my baby to the vet again today.
2000007794,enthusiasm,Dubai!!! Still getting settled in here.
2000007795,enthusiasm,I’m seriously wanting a camera right now!
2000007796,enthusiasm,Heading to the chiropractor to figure out what’s going on with my ankle.
2000007797,enthusiasm,@Hilareeee But…but…I’m not!
2000007798,enthusiasm,Need to pick up a Bluetooth device for my machine.
2000007799,enthusiasm,The JBs are all about keeping secrets! “Oooooh!”
2000007800,enthusiasm,@MelzieC I saw the show listing and noticed it’s on a Wednesday!
2000007801,enthusiasm,"@capitaln Um…no, we’ll probably stay inside a lot; maybe the skirt will still work!"
2000007802,enthusiasm,"I barely got 4 hours of sleep, but it feels like 8 thanks to the Lord—although now I’ve got a sore throat as I push through this paper!"
2000007803,enthusiasm,"Feeling like taking a day off but can’t afford to; looking forward to the DFB Cup final tomorrow night—go, Werder!"
2000007804,enthusiasm,"@KatMeyer Hey, do we need the #beatweetup badge tonight? Just realized mine’s still at home!"
2000007805,enthusiasm,I NEED A GARDEN—being inside on a sunny day is the worst.
2000007806,enthusiasm,Fcuk! I said that in Tagalog because I have no idea what to do anymore!
2000007807,enthusiasm,@umphreysmcgee Amazing podcast! Wish you guys had more Chicago shows this summer. The only time I’ll see you is at Alpine.
2000007808,enthusiasm,"@yvetterdz84 Nah, he won’t, but I’ll just sit here and enjoy the view! :-P"
2000007809,enthusiasm,@Katiekins08 I want to go SOOOO BAD!!!
2000007810,enthusiasm,@orangelight Because the one I was having at that moment woke me up.
2000007811,enthusiasm,"At work, then back to my baby’s place afterward."
2000007812,enthusiasm,Second visit: La Ventana de los Cielos foundation was postponed two weeks; I was so pumped to meet the kids! Now I have to wait two more weeks.
2000007813,enthusiasm,"@epiphanygirl Wish I were in Dallas…can I still say “ow!?” LOL By the way, you misspelled my name! It’s all good, thanks for the #FF love!"
2000007814,enthusiasm,It’s Friday!!!…and it’s sunny…but I’m stuck working inside.
2000007815,enthusiasm,Just woke up; need to head out for class in an hour.
2000007816,enthusiasm,"@JanaiChristian While I’m inside Elk Grove Village working all day, someone should be enjoying it!"
2000007817,enthusiasm,Went out to try to catch a swarm—found it in a roof gable end. Set up a bait hive and crossing my fingers now!
2000007818,enthusiasm,"@DisneyLuis Aww, what happened?"
2000007819,enthusiasm,"@jodiekearns I’m here all weekend, expecting it to be way too hot!"
2000007820,enthusiasm,@shadowfish But I’d have to drive…or grab a cab. Do you have a pool table or jukebox?
2000007821,enthusiasm,"@HDEnvy Thanks! Unfortunately, the EU had issues with his satellite provider, so even though his TV looks great, it’s basically useless."
2000007822,enthusiasm,"Back in Lancaster and already bored—can’t wait to start work! Missing you, Hel!"
2000007823,enthusiasm,I’ve got a headache…
2000007824,enthusiasm,I need to get a cheap Verizon phone.
2000007825,enthusiasm,"@xac Reminders are super helpful! Speaking of which, we haven’t done a Posture Check in a while…"
2000007826,enthusiasm,"Everyone’s so bummed about the no-touching rule. At least you get to see them, which is more than most of us get!"
2000007827,enthusiasm,"@ChantiParnell I want to be the top fan! Sharing, maybe?!!"
2000007828,enthusiasm,"@loribartolozzi Just found out five minutes ago; Mom says his speech is still slurred, but he seems to be doing okay."
2000007829,enthusiasm,"Baby, I need you here with me right now!"
2000007830,enthusiasm,@tinabojo I wish I were there!
2000007831,enthusiasm,"I hope it rains today! Like, full thunderstorm mode! But it probably won’t."
2000007832,enthusiasm,"What a meeting…YAY, more work for me!"
2000007833,enthusiasm,Found some fantastic places but might have to wait until my car’s paid off in two years to play it safe.
2000007834,enthusiasm,Wish I were the one going to our Bahamas conference next week!
2000007835,enthusiasm,Stood outside and got the absolute WORST butterflies!
2000007836,enthusiasm,@bryanhowl @kat10187 You guys can push through!
2000007837,enthusiasm,I’m ready for it to be 5 o’clock already.
2000007838,enthusiasm,"@INKDMOM I know, right?! I have such a lead foot!"
2000007839,enthusiasm,"Finally have a chance to play WoW this week, and I’m stuck at “authenticating.”"
2000007840,enthusiasm,"Lazy day in is so nice, but I probably should go out."
2000007841,enthusiasm,Really wish someone would make a group chat theme for Adium with better contrast for IRC; yMous is just too low!
2000007842,enthusiasm,Working at la bootay…where’s the warm weather when you need it???
2000007843,enthusiasm,"Sushi place was closed, but still had a great lunch with Angel!"
2000007844,enthusiasm,"Back at school again…bored, and everyone’s playing country music—it’s the worst!!! XD"
2000007845,enthusiasm,@mikeneumann You just want to go? I know the feeling…I’m ready to get back to the mountains but won’t until July.
2000007846,enthusiasm,@sarahbellum You’re not the only one.
2000007847,enthusiasm,"My mouth’s so sore! I have to wear these annoying retainers so my teeth don’t shift. On another note, got a new swimsuit for doing laps!"
2000007848,enthusiasm,Can’t wait to be done with work.
2000007849,enthusiasm,I really don’t want Warren to die; he’s such an amazing character! But Clare? She should just die once and for all.
2000007850,enthusiasm,Trying to figure out what to do tonight.
2000007851,enthusiasm,"@FuschiaFoot sold, so I hit cash and covered the tax from my tips, but my drawer ended up $5 short—no clue why."
2000007852,enthusiasm,"Bro, Tim just told me they're doing a Red vs Blue animated series! It'll either air on Adult Swim or G4; hoping for AS since I don't get G4!"
2000007853,enthusiasm,"Exploring my N96 phone...it's so cool! Still, kinda wish I'd gotten the Samsung Omnia instead."
2000007854,enthusiasm,"@garrulous_gal Yes, of course! cough I mean, totally not, just another 1.5 hours of testing and debugging."
2000007855,enthusiasm,Had to bring my baby to the vet yet again today.
2000007856,enthusiasm,Dubai!!! Still working on getting settled here.
2000007857,enthusiasm,I’ve been really wanting a new camera lately!
2000007858,enthusiasm,Off to the chiropractor to figure out what's up with my ankle.
2000007859,enthusiasm,@Hilareeee But...but...I'm really not!
2000007860,enthusiasm,Need to grab a Bluetooth device for my machine.
2000007861,enthusiasm,The JBs are always keeping secrets! “Oooooh!”
2000007862,enthusiasm,@MelzieC I checked the show listings and saw it’s on Wednesday!!
2000007863,enthusiasm,"@capitaln Um…nope, we’ll probably be indoors a lot. The skirt might still work though!"
2000007864,enthusiasm,"Got barely four hours of sleep, but the Lord made it feel like eight! Downside is I’ve now got a sore throat while finishing this paper."
2000007865,enthusiasm,I’m dying to take a day off but really can’t; at least there’s the DFB Cup final tomorrow—go Werder!
2000007866,enthusiasm,"@KatMeyer Hey, do we need our #beatweetup badges tonight? Just realized I forgot mine at home!"
2000007867,enthusiasm,I NEED A GARDEN—being cooped up when it's sunny is no fun at all.
2000007868,enthusiasm,Fudge! I just can’t take it anymore! Saying this in Tagalog ‘cause I’m at a loss!
2000007869,enthusiasm,@umphreysmcgee Fantastic podcast! Just wish you guys had more Chicago shows lined up this summer. The only time I'll see you is at Alpine.
2000007870,enthusiasm,"@yvetterdz84 Nah, he won't, but I'll be here soaking up the view! :-P"
2000007871,enthusiasm,@Katiekins08 I want to go SO BAD!!!
2000007872,enthusiasm,@orangelight Because the one I had at that moment woke me up.
2000007873,enthusiasm,"At work now, then heading to my baby’s place after."
2000007874,enthusiasm,Visit #2: The La Ventana de los Cielos foundation trip got delayed two weeks; I was so excited to meet the kids! Now I have to wait longer.
2000007875,enthusiasm,"@epiphanygirl Wish I could be in Dallas…can I still say “ow?” LOL And hey, you misspelled my name! No worries, thanks for the #FF love!"
2000007876,enthusiasm,Friday is here!!! And the sun’s out…too bad I’m working inside.
2000007877,enthusiasm,Just woke up; need to leave for class soon.
2000007878,enthusiasm,"@JanaiChristian While I’m stuck indoors in Elk Grove Village all day working, someone should enjoy it for me!"
2000007879,enthusiasm,Just went out to try catching a swarm; they ended up in a roof gable end. Set up a bait hive and hoping it works!
2000007880,enthusiasm,"@DisneyLuis Oh no, what happened?"
2000007881,enthusiasm,"@jodiekearns I’ll be there all weekend, bracing for it to be way too hot."
2000007882,enthusiasm,@shadowfish But I’d have to drive…or call a cab. Do you have a pool table or jukebox?
2000007883,enthusiasm,"@HDEnvy Thanks! Sadly, the EU had some trouble with his satellite provider, so even though his TV looks great, it's practically useless now."
2000007884,enthusiasm,"Back in Lancaster and already feeling bored…can't wait to get started at work! Miss you, Hel!"
2000007885,enthusiasm,Got a headache…
2000007886,enthusiasm,I need to pick up a cheap Verizon phone.
2000007887,enthusiasm,"@xac Reminders are so handy! Speaking of which, we haven’t done a Posture Check in forever..."
2000007888,enthusiasm,Everyone’s so disappointed about the no-touching rule. You still get to see them! That’s more than most of us get to do.
2000007889,enthusiasm,@ChantiParnell I want to be the #1 fan! Sharing spots??!!
2000007890,enthusiasm,"@loribartolozzi Just heard five minutes ago; Mom said his speech is still a little slurred, but he's doing okay."
2000007891,enthusiasm,"Baby, I really need you with me right now!"
2000007892,enthusiasm,@tinabojo Wish I was there with you!
2000007893,enthusiasm,"I’m hoping for rain today! A full-on thunderstorm would be amazing, but it probably won’t happen."
2000007894,enthusiasm,"What a meeting…yay, more work for me."
2000007895,enthusiasm,Found some great spots but probably better to wait until my car is paid off in two years.
2000007896,enthusiasm,Wishing I were the one going to our Bahamas conference next week!
2000007897,enthusiasm,Stood outside with the WORST case of butterflies ever!
2000007898,enthusiasm,@bryanhowl @kat10187 You both can power through this!
2000007899,enthusiasm,I’m counting down for it to be 5 p.m. already.
2000007900,enthusiasm,"@INKDMOM I know, right?! I’m such a speed demon!"
2000007901,enthusiasm,"First time all week I get to play WoW, and I’m stuck at “authenticating.”"
2000007902,enthusiasm,"Lazy day inside is so nice, but I really should get out."
2000007903,enthusiasm,Really wish someone would create a group chat theme for Adium that’s better for IRC. yMous has just too little contrast!
2000007904,enthusiasm,Working at La Bootay…where’s the warm weather when you need it??
2000007905,enthusiasm,"The sushi place was closed, but still had a nice lunch with Angel!"
2000007906,enthusiasm,"Back at school, bored again…and everyone here is playing country music, which is just the worst! XD"
2000007907,enthusiasm,@mikeneumann Do you just want to go already? I know how it feels…I’m ready to get back to the mountains but won’t till July.
2000007908,enthusiasm,@sarahbellum You’re not the only one feeling like that.
2000007909,enthusiasm,"My mouth is sore…I have to wear these annoying retainers so my teeth don’t shift! But on a good note, got a new swimsuit for laps!"
2000007910,enthusiasm,Can’t wait to get off work.
2000007911,enthusiasm,I really don’t want Warren to die; he’s such a great character! I wish Clare would just die already!
2000007912,enthusiasm,Looking for something fun to do tonight.
2000007913,enthusiasm,Desperately want to pick up a camera soon!
2000007914,enthusiasm,Dubai life! Still trying to feel fully settled in here.
2000007915,enthusiasm,"Was planning on a chill day, but I’ve got so much work piling up now."
2000007916,enthusiasm,"Could use a day off so badly, but I’ll power through with the DFB Cup final tomorrow—let’s go, Werder!"
2000007917,enthusiasm,"Just realized I left my #beatweetup badge at home! @KatMeyer, is it mandatory for tonight?"
2000007918,enthusiasm,Really craving a sunny outdoor garden—sitting inside on days like this just feels wrong.
2000007919,enthusiasm,"@umphreysmcgee Amazing podcast, as always! I just wish there were more Chicago shows lined up this summer. Alpine’s my only chance to see you guys."
2000007920,enthusiasm,"Was having the best sleep, but this dream jolted me awake."
2000007921,enthusiasm,"At work, and later heading over to my partner’s place—so ready for it."
2000007922,enthusiasm,"@epiphanygirl Wish I could be hanging out in Dallas right now. Also, hey, it’s not a huge deal, but you misspelled my name! Thanks for the #FF shoutout, though!"
2000007923,enthusiasm,"Friday's finally here, the sun’s shining, but I’m stuck working indoors…"
2000007924,enthusiasm,"Quick wake-up, and now I need to get moving for class."
2000007925,enthusiasm,"Went out to catch a swarm; they settled in a roof gable, so I’m crossing my fingers the bait hive does its thing!"
2000007926,enthusiasm,Had to bring my pet to the vet again today—it’s been rough.
2000007927,enthusiasm,@loribartolozzi Got the update five minutes ago; mom says he’s still slurring a bit but seems like he’s doing okay.
2000007928,enthusiasm,"Hey babe, I could really use you here right now."
2000007929,enthusiasm,@tinabojo Wishing I could be there with you!
2000007930,enthusiasm,Would love for it to rain today—full storm mode! Though it probably won’t.
2000007931,enthusiasm,Just wrapped up a meeting…which means more tasks on my plate!
2000007932,enthusiasm,"Checked out some awesome places, but I think I’ll wait until my car’s fully paid off."
2000007933,enthusiasm,Totally jealous of whoever’s going to the Bahamas conference next week!
2000007934,enthusiasm,"@bryanhowl @kat10187 Stay strong, guys! You’ve got this!"
2000007935,enthusiasm,Waiting for it to be 5 p.m. is taking forever.
2000007936,enthusiasm,"@INKDMOM I know, right?! I’ve got such a lead foot on the road."
2000007937,enthusiasm,"Finally get a chance to play WoW, and I’m just stuck waiting at “authenticating.”"
2000007938,enthusiasm,"Having a cozy day in is great, but I should probably head out and do something."
2000007939,enthusiasm,"Really need someone to design a high-contrast group chat theme for Adium, like IRC-style!"
2000007940,enthusiasm,"Serving at La Bootay, but I’m dreaming of warmer days!"
2000007941,enthusiasm,"Went out for sushi, but the place was closed—still had a nice meal with Angel, though."
2000007942,enthusiasm,"Back to the grind at school, and these people won’t stop playing country music…not my vibe!"
2000007943,enthusiasm,"@mikeneumann I totally get it; just want to head out already. Can’t wait to be back in the mountains, even though it won’t happen until July."
2000007944,enthusiasm,@sarahbellum Don’t worry; you’re not alone in feeling like this.
2000007945,enthusiasm,"Ugh, my mouth hurts from these retainers, but I did get a new swimsuit for laps, so that’s exciting!"
2000007946,enthusiasm,Counting down till I can clock out of work.
2000007947,enthusiasm,"Not ready for Warren to die; he’s such a cool character. Clare, though…she can go anytime."
2000007948,enthusiasm,Wondering what to do tonight—need to make some plans!
2000007949,enthusiasm,Feeling more and more like I need a garden—being inside on sunny days is no fun.
2000007950,enthusiasm,"Starting to feel homesick for Lancaster already; work can’t come soon enough, but missing everyone there."
2000007951,enthusiasm,My head is pounding right now—just need some peace and quiet.
2000007952,enthusiasm,Need to find a basic Verizon phone without breaking the bank.
2000007953,enthusiasm,"@xac Can’t deny reminders are a good thing! Speaking of which, when’s our next posture check?"
2000007954,enthusiasm,It’s a bummer about the no-touching rule; at least you all still get to be around them—that’s more than most!
2000007955,enthusiasm,@ChantiParnell I’m so ready to be their number one fan! You in for a little friendly competition?
2000007956,enthusiasm,"@MelzieC Just saw the show schedule, and it’s on a Wednesday—perfect!"
2000007957,enthusiasm,@shadowfish I’d have to either drive or grab a cab. Do you have a pool table or maybe a jukebox?
2000007958,enthusiasm,"@HDEnvy Thanks! Sadly, his satellite provider is acting up, so even with a great TV setup, it’s pretty much useless for now."
2000007959,enthusiasm,Wishing I could be at that conference in the Bahamas next week; sounds like a dream trip!
2000007960,enthusiasm,Butterflies are hitting hard waiting out here—nerves are all over the place.
2000007961,enthusiasm,@bryanhowl @kat10187 You’ve got this; just take it one step at a time!
2000007962,enthusiasm,I want it to be quitting time already!
2000007963,enthusiasm,@INKDMOM Right?! My foot practically has a mind of its own on the gas pedal.
2000007964,enthusiasm,"After a week, I finally have time for WoW, and now I’m stuck on “authenticating”—talk about frustrating!"
2000007965,enthusiasm,"Loving this lazy day in, but I feel like I should go out and be productive."
2000007966,enthusiasm,"Wish someone would make a more readable, high-contrast Adium theme for group chats—it would make a huge difference."
2000007967,enthusiasm,"Working at La Bootay today, but I’m seriously craving some sunshine!"
2000007968,enthusiasm,"Tried to get sushi, but the place was closed—still made the best of it with Angel."
2000007969,enthusiasm,"Back in class, and all I hear is country music—definitely not my choice!"
2000007970,enthusiasm,@mikeneumann It’s that feeling of just wanting to go! Already missing the mountains; July can’t come soon enough.
2000007971,enthusiasm,"@sarahbellum Trust me, you’re not the only one feeling this way."
2000007972,enthusiasm,"My retainer is killing me, but on the upside, I got a new swimsuit for doing laps!"
2000007973,enthusiasm,Can’t wait for the workday to end already.
2000007974,enthusiasm,"Hoping Warren doesn’t get killed off; he’s such an amazing character! Clare, on the other hand, could go anytime."
2000007975,enthusiasm,Trying to come up with something fun to do tonight—open to ideas!
2000007976,enthusiasm,"Just craving a bit of rain today—a full-on thunderstorm would be perfect, but it’s probably too much to hope for."
2000007977,enthusiasm,That meeting was intense... Looks like more work for me now!
2000007978,enthusiasm,"Found some great places, but I might need to hold off until my car is fully paid off in a couple of years."
2000007979,enthusiasm,Wishing I could be the one heading to the Bahamas conference next week.
2000007980,enthusiasm,Standing here with the biggest butterflies ever—my nerves are on high alert!
2000007981,enthusiasm,I’d really like it to be 5 p.m. already—this day is dragging.
2000007982,enthusiasm,@Hilareeee But… but… I’m really not!

2000009606,boredom,Feeling absolutely exhausted right now.
2000009607,boredom,Still stuck in line at Tryst… this is taking forever.
2000009608,boredom,Why did I agree to work a double shift? Definitely regretting that decision.
2000009609,boredom,Really bored… might just call it a night and go to sleep.
2000009610,boredom,This is cutting right through me—way too deep.
2000009611,boredom,So over Twitter… maybe that’s why I haven’t logged in for a month.
2000009612,boredom,Haven’t managed to buy a single thing from the ovi store—always getting server errors at checkout.
2000009613,boredom,Tweeting live from the tarmac in Cork… delayed again.
2000009614,boredom,Feeling queasy and can’t seem to fall asleep.
2000009615,boredom,"Work is dragging today, and the tubes are so slow…"
2000009616,boredom,Still awake… I really wish I could just sleep.
2000009617,boredom,This show was definitely not one of Gogol Bordello’s best. Maybe an old-school game will help pass the time.
2000009618,boredom,"I know the feeling, @Natalija—it’s seriously the worst."
2000009619,boredom,Bored to the max right now… nothing to do.
2000009620,boredom,Final chemistry class of the year! At least my birthday is sandwiched between two lab days.
2000009621,boredom,Just got woken up by my brother for homework help… not thrilled about it.
2000009622,boredom,"Woke up on my day off, but they still need me at work. Dentist and MRI later, too—what a day."
2000009623,boredom,Editing this video is a nightmare… it’s taking forever.
2000009624,boredom,"No clue what to do today. The weather’s amazing, and I’m stuck here."
2000009625,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing is the worst… less fun than sorting because you have to go through every detail again.
2000009626,boredom,Totally bored… wish I’d gone to Pisay today. Wonder who’s there.
2000009627,boredom,Another day of documentation… it never ends.
2000009628,boredom,Why am I not asleep right now?
2000009629,boredom,Studying is finally catching up to me—feeling so drained.
2000009630,boredom,Bored out of my mind… RC is down for maintenance.
2000009631,boredom,"Need something to do... hello, boredom!"
2000009632,boredom,It’s way too hot in the office. Could really use some AC right now.
2000009633,boredom,Cleaning out the old apartment today… yay for chores.
2000009634,boredom,@memow What did you think of the finale? Felt like a cheap ending to me.
2000009635,boredom,"In math class, just counting down the minutes until lunch. Senior year can’t end soon enough!"
2000009636,boredom,Trying to finish this assignment… someone please help me get it done!
2000009637,boredom,@MeanMillies big sigh of boredom.
2000009638,boredom,"No matter how much I sleep, I’m still always tired."
2000009639,boredom,Bored out of my mind… the weather isn’t helping either.
2000009640,boredom,"Math is a struggle, but I’m pretty sure math hates me more than I hate it."
2000009641,boredom,"Okay, I’m officially super bored... is anyone else around?"
2000009642,boredom,Textiles class is dragging… I am SO bored.
2000009643,boredom,"Moving out in the rain… definitely not fun. Goodbye, Hamptons."
2000009644,boredom,This weekend is shaping up to be a real letdown.
2000009645,boredom,Quick lunch at work before I have to write out 500 envelopes by hand.
2000009646,boredom,"YouTube isn’t working, and all I wanted was to watch Britain’s Got Talent. Pity party for one."
2000009647,boredom,@h269 Studying for finals since exams are looming… the struggle.
2000009648,boredom,It’s way too quiet here without Bunny… lonely vibes all around.
2000009649,boredom,@KatherineLunt Bored tonight… wish your book was here with me.
2000009650,boredom,"Just got home from the bank, and I’m pretty sure the teller was flirting. Not interested."
2000009651,boredom,The struggle to get back to work after hitting a deadline is real.
2000009652,boredom,Spent too much money today! These long tube rides aren’t helping.
2000009653,boredom,I just want to be at home… hate being stuck at work alone.
2000009654,boredom,"The weather’s perfect, and I’m stuck at work. Frustrating!"
2000009655,boredom,Bored out of my mind—anyone around to chat?
2000009656,boredom,Totally bored… my best friend doesn’t want to hang out.
2000009657,boredom,Tired of constantly feeling sick… when will it end?
2000009658,boredom,This bus is moving so slowly… I’ve been on it for over an hour.
2000009659,boredom,Not feeling the love from my man today… what’s going on?
2000009660,boredom,"It’s been an hour, and I’m still waiting… patience is wearing thin."
2000009661,boredom,@shaveblog Flash not being GPU-accelerated is a pain—Atom 330 can’t handle HD video fullscreen. Plex has the same issue.
2000009662,boredom,"Craving white chocolate macadamia cookies from Mrs. Fields, but the mall is too far. Guess I’ll bake my own."
2000009663,boredom,@BlueEyedGirl18 Been waiting over an hour… dreadful.
2000009664,boredom,"Just woke up feeling lazy, but I need to get a workout in."
2000009665,boredom,@BOPandTigerBeat Missed the boys’ chat yesterday… first one I’ve ever missed!
2000009666,boredom,"Feeling like I can’t keep my eyes open, but here I am."
2000009667,boredom,Still waiting... the line just isn’t moving.
2000009668,boredom,Double shift blues—why did I sign up for this?
2000009669,boredom,Bored out of my mind… bed is calling my name.
2000009670,boredom,This is hitting way too deep… feeling it in my soul.
2000009671,boredom,"Logged into Twitter and, wow, it’s just as dull as ever—no wonder I stayed away for so long."
2000009672,boredom,The ovi store checkout keeps crashing—can’t buy anything at all.
2000009673,boredom,"Stuck on the tarmac, delayed again—come on, Cork Airport."
2000009674,boredom,Feeling sick and totally restless—can’t sleep a wink.
2000009675,boredom,Fridays at work feel like they move in slow motion…
2000009676,boredom,"Tossing and turning, wishing I could just fall asleep."
2000009677,boredom,This Gogol Bordello show was underwhelming—maybe some old games will pass the time.
2000009678,boredom,"Totally been there, @Natalija—it’s brutal."
2000009679,boredom,Really don’t know what to do—bored beyond belief.
2000009680,boredom,"Chemistry class over for the year, finally! And my birthday’s right in the middle of two lab days—great."
2000009681,boredom,Just got dragged out of bed to help my brother with homework… not amused.
2000009682,boredom,"Day off, but still called into work. And I’ve got a dentist appointment AND an MRI later. What a lineup."
2000009683,boredom,Editing this video is endless—so much footage to get through.
2000009684,boredom,"Perfect weather outside, and I’m just sitting here… go figure."
2000009685,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing is a special kind of boring—you still have to look through everything one by one.
2000009686,boredom,"Wish I went to Pisay today instead of being stuck here, bored. Wonder who’s there."
2000009687,boredom,Yet another day of documenting things… joy.
2000009688,boredom,Why am I still awake at this hour?
2000009689,boredom,Feels like studying is finally breaking me down… exhausted.
2000009690,boredom,"RC is in maintenance mode, and I am beyond bored."
2000009691,boredom,"Need something, anything to do right now—this boredom is killing me."
2000009692,boredom,"It’s boiling in the office, and there’s no air conditioning."
2000009693,boredom,Cleaning out the old place today… yay for moving day.
2000009694,boredom,@memow That finale was underwhelming… felt like a total cop-out.
2000009695,boredom,Waiting for lunch in math class… senior year can’t end fast enough.
2000009696,boredom,Trying to wrap up this assignment… could really use some help!
2000009697,boredom,@MeanMillies Boo indeed… total boredom over here.
2000009698,boredom,"Can’t shake this tired feeling, no matter how much I sleep."
2000009699,boredom,"The weather’s gross, I’m bored, and this is my last weekend here—what a combo."
2000009700,boredom,"Math and I just don’t get along, but I think math hates me more than I hate it."
2000009701,boredom,Super bored… anyone else around to chat?
2000009702,boredom,"Textiles class is dragging on, and I’m so bored."
2000009703,boredom,"Moving day in the rain… definitely not how I planned it. Bye, Hamptons!"
2000009704,boredom,This weekend is looking pretty bleak.
2000009705,boredom,"Quick lunch at work, then back to addressing 500 envelopes by hand—fun."
2000009706,boredom,"YouTube is down, and all I wanted was to watch Britain’s Got Talent. Might throw myself a pity party."
2000009707,boredom,@h269 Deep in revision mode—exams are creeping up fast.
2000009708,boredom,Way too quiet and lonely here without Bunny…
2000009709,boredom,@KatherineLunt Seriously bored tonight… wish I had your book with me.
2000009710,boredom,"Just back from the bank, and I swear the teller was hitting on me. Not interested."
2000009711,boredom,The energy it takes to get back to work after a deadline… it’s rough.
2000009712,boredom,Spent way too much money today… these tube rides feel endless.
2000009713,boredom,All I want is to go home—hate being stuck alone at work.

2000009715,boredom,Bored out of my mind… anyone around for a chat?
2000009716,boredom,Super bored… my best friend doesn’t feel like hanging out.
2000009717,boredom,Tired of being sick all the time… it’s getting really old.
2000009718,boredom,This bus is crawling—I’ve been stuck on it for an hour now.
2000009719,boredom,Not feeling the love from my man today… what’s going on?
2000009720,boredom,Been waiting over an hour… seriously losing my patience here.
2000009721,boredom,"@shaveblog Flash without GPU support is a nightmare—Atom 330 can’t handle HD videos. Same issue on Plex, too."
2000009722,boredom,"Craving those white chocolate macadamia cookies from Mrs. Fields, but the mall’s too far. Might just make my own."
2000009723,boredom,@BlueEyedGirl18 Over an hour and still waiting… this is rough.
2000009724,boredom,"Just woke up and feeling incredibly lazy… need to get moving, though."
2000009725,boredom,@BOPandTigerBeat Missed the chat with the boys yesterday! First time I’ve missed one!
2000009726,boredom,Feeling totally wiped out right now.
2000009727,boredom,"Still here, waiting in line… it’s never-ending."
2000009728,boredom,Regretting this double shift—what was I thinking?
2000009729,boredom,Bored out of my mind… might just go to bed early.
2000009730,boredom,This is hitting me on another level—feeling it deep.
2000009731,boredom,"Logged back into Twitter, and yep, still boring… I remember why I left."
2000009732,boredom,Still can’t get anything from the ovi store—checkout just keeps failing.
2000009733,boredom,Waiting on the tarmac in Cork… delayed flights are the worst.
2000009734,boredom,Feeling nauseous and can’t sleep… what a combo.
2000009735,boredom,The tubes at work are moving so slowly… typical Friday.
2000009736,boredom,"Can’t fall asleep, no matter how hard I try."
2000009737,boredom,Not the best show tonight… maybe some retro games will help pass the time.
2000009738,boredom,@Natalija I feel you… it’s rough.
2000009739,boredom,Super bored right now—nothing’s going on.

2000009745,boredom,"@solobasssteve Filing is the worst part—it’s so tedious, going through everything."
2000009746,boredom,Kinda wish I’d gone to Pisay today… I wonder who’s there.
2000009747,boredom,Another day stuck doing documentation… ugh.
2000009748,boredom,Why am I even awake right now?

2000009777,boredom,So tired of feeling sick all the time… it’s getting old.
2000009778,boredom,This bus ride is so slow… been on here forever.
2000009779,boredom,Not feeling appreciated by my man today… what’s going on?
2000009780,boredom,Been waiting over an hour now… really losing patience.
2000009781,boredom,"@shaveblog Without GPU acceleration, Flash is such a pain—HD video is nearly impossible."
2000009782,boredom,"Craving white chocolate macadamia cookies, but the mall is way too far. Might just make my own."
2000009783,boredom,@BlueEyedGirl18 Waiting over an hour now… this is torture.
2000009784,boredom,Just woke up feeling so lazy… gotta get up and moving somehow.
2000009785,boredom,@BOPandTigerBeat Can’t believe I missed the chat yesterday… first one I’ve missed!
2000009786,boredom,I'm completely exhausted.
2000009787,boredom,Waiting around at Tryst… feels like forever.
2000009788,boredom,What was I thinking agreeing to a double shift?
2000009789,boredom,I’m unbelievably bored… might just hit the sack early.
2000009790,boredom,"This feels so deep, it’s like it’s cutting right through me."
2000009791,boredom,Twitter is boring me to tears… now I remember why I stayed away.
2000009792,boredom,Still can’t get anything from the ovi store… server keeps failing.
2000009793,boredom,"Tweeting from the tarmac at Cork Airport, and we’re delayed."
2000009794,boredom,Feeling queasy and can’t seem to get any rest.
2000009795,boredom,Why are Friday tubes at work always so slow?
2000009796,boredom,"OMG, I just cannot sleep—so frustrating."
2000009797,boredom,Gogol Bordello < expected… might turn to Civilization II for some distraction.
2000009798,boredom,@Natalija I feel you… it’s such a drag.
2000009799,boredom,"Really, really bored—no idea what to do."
2000009800,boredom,"Last chemistry class for the year! My birthday’s squeezed between two lab days, lucky me."
2000009801,boredom,Just got woken up by my brother asking for homework help… not pleased.
2000009802,boredom,"Woke up on my day off, and they need me to work. Plus, dentist and MRI later."
2000009803,boredom,Editing this video feels endless… why did I start this?
2000009804,boredom,"Beautiful weather, and I’m just stuck here doing nothing."
2000009805,boredom,"@solobasssteve Filing is such a chore… I’d rather be sorting, but it’s all gotta get done."
2000009806,boredom,Totally bored… kind of wish I’d gone to Pisay today. Wonder who’s there.
2000009807,boredom,Another day of nothing but documentation… sigh.
2000009808,boredom,"Why am I still awake? Sleep, where are you?"
2000009809,boredom,I think studying is finally starting to wear me down.
2000009810,boredom,So bored… RC is down for maintenance.
2000009811,boredom,Need something to do—boredom is setting in hard.
2000009812,boredom,It’s stifling in the office… any chance for some AC?
2000009813,boredom,Cleaning the old apartment today… the joys of moving.
2000009814,boredom,@memow What did you think of that finale? I thought it felt like an easy way out.
2000009815,boredom,"In math class, just counting the minutes until lunch… senioritis is real."
2000009816,boredom,Trying to wrap up this assignment… please help me get this done.
2000009817,boredom,@MeanMillies Boredom central over here.
2000009818,boredom,"No matter how much sleep I get, I’m still tired."
2000009819,boredom,"The weather is awful, and I’m so bored… perfect combo for a blah day."
2000009820,boredom,Math and I just don’t mix… pretty sure it hates me back.
2000009821,boredom,"Alright, I’m officially bored out of my mind… anyone else around?"
2000009822,boredom,"Stuck in textiles, and I’m so bored I could scream."
2000009823,boredom,Moving day in the rain… the last of my time in the Hamptons.
2000009824,boredom,This weekend is looking like it’s going to be a total letdown.
2000009825,boredom,"Quick bite at work, then back to hand-addressing 500 envelopes… my poor wrist."
2000009826,boredom,"YouTube isn’t working, and all I wanted was to watch Britain’s Got Talent. Might just throw myself a pity party."
2000009827,boredom,"@h269 Deep in study mode since finals are coming up soon… motivation, where are you?"
2000009828,boredom,It’s so quiet here without Bunny… feeling pretty lonely.
2000009829,boredom,@KatherineLunt I’m unbelievably bored tonight… your book would be the perfect distraction.
2000009830,boredom,"Just got back from the bank, and I think the teller was flirting. No thanks."
2000009831,boredom,Getting back to work after a deadline is harder than expected.
2000009832,boredom,"Spent way too much money today, and the tube rides feel like forever."
2000009833,boredom,All I want is to go home… hate being stuck here at work alone.

2000009837,boredom,I’m exhausted from being sick all the time… when does it end?
2000009838,boredom,This bus ride is taking forever—been on here for over an hour.
2000009839,boredom,Feeling really unappreciated by my man today… what’s going on?
2000009840,boredom,"It’s been over an hour, and I’m still waiting… patience is running thin."
2000009841,boredom,"@shaveblog Flash isn’t GPU-accelerated, which means Atom 330 can’t handle HD videos fullscreen… Plex has the same issue."
2000009842,boredom,"I really want some Mrs. Fields white chocolate macadamia cookies, but the mall is so far. Might just bake my own."
2000009843,boredom,@BlueEyedGirl18 Been waiting an hour and fifteen minutes now… unbearable.
2000009844,boredom,"Just woke up feeling so lazy… I should work out, but I’m struggling."

2000009846,boredom,"Can’t believe how tired I am, but still can’t sleep."
2000009847,boredom,Waiting here at Tryst… not sure if this line will ever move.
2000009848,boredom,Double shift was a mistake—never again!
2000009849,boredom,Unbelievably bored… might just head to bed early.
2000009850,boredom,"This feeling is so intense, it’s like it’s piercing me."
2000009851,boredom,I think I remember why I haven’t been on Twitter… feels dead.
2000009852,boredom,Server error again… the ovi store won’t let me buy anything.
2000009853,boredom,"Stuck on the tarmac in Cork… another delay, just great."
2000009854,boredom,Feeling really queasy and can’t get any sleep.
2000009855,boredom,The tubes at work are so slow… it’s only Friday!
2000009856,boredom,"Ugh, I just cannot get any sleep tonight."
2000009857,boredom,Disappointed by this Gogol Bordello show… maybe I’ll play Civilization II.
2000009858,boredom,@Natalija I know the feeling—this is a total drag.
2000009859,boredom,Could not be more bored… what to do?
2000009860,boredom,Last chemistry class for the year—counting down to my birthday now.
2000009861,boredom,Got woken up by my brother needing homework help… not thrilled.
2000009862,boredom,"Day off, but they still need me to work… plus I have to go to the dentist and for an MRI."
2000009863,boredom,This video is taking forever to edit… I’m so over it.
2000009864,boredom,"It’s gorgeous outside, and I’m stuck here doing absolutely nothing."
2000009865,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing is such a pain… wish I could just toss it all out.
2000009866,boredom,I should’ve gone to Pisay today… stuck here and bored out of my mind.
2000009867,boredom,Another day of documentation… does it ever end?
2000009868,boredom,Why am I up? I need sleep but can’t seem to get any.
2000009869,boredom,I think all this studying is wearing me down… exhausted.
2000009870,boredom,Nothing to do since RC is in maintenance… bored here.
2000009871,boredom,Need something to do—this boredom is getting intense.
2000009872,boredom,"It’s sweltering in the office… AC, please?"
2000009873,boredom,Cleaning the old place today… not exactly a fun day off.
2000009874,boredom,@memow What did you think of that finale? It felt like an easy way out to me.
2000009875,boredom,"In math class, just waiting for the clock to hit lunchtime… ready to be done."
2000009876,boredom,Trying to get this assignment done… could use some divine intervention.
2000009877,boredom,@MeanMillies Serious boredom right now.
2000009878,boredom,"Still tired, no matter how much sleep I get."
2000009879,boredom,"This weather is gross, and I’m so bored… could this day get any more dull?"
2000009880,boredom,Math and I will never be friends… I think the feeling’s mutual.
2000009881,boredom,"Alright, I’m so bored… is anyone else around to chat?"
2000009882,boredom,Textiles class is dragging… I’m dying of boredom.
2000009883,boredom,"Moving in the rain… why today, of all days? Goodbye, Hamptons."
2000009884,boredom,This weekend is shaping up to be a total snooze-fest.
2000009885,boredom,"Quick lunch at work, then back to addressing envelopes… wrist is going to hate me."
2000009886,boredom,"YouTube isn’t working, and I was all set to watch Britain’s Got Talent… now what?"
2000009887,boredom,@h269 Buried in revision mode—finals are coming up fast.
2000009888,boredom,Way too quiet here without Bunny around… missing that little guy.
2000009889,boredom,@KatherineLunt Really bored tonight… wish I had your book to keep me entertained.
2000009890,boredom,"Just got back from the bank, and I think the teller was interested… but nah."
2000009891,boredom,Getting back to work after a deadline feels impossible today.
2000009892,boredom,Spent too much today… long tube ride home to think about it.
2000009893,boredom,All I want is to go home—being at work alone is the worst.
2000009894,boredom,"Such a beautiful day, and I’m missing it all from work."

2000009909,boredom,So bored I might just go to sleep—no point in staying up.
2000009910,boredom,This is cutting deep… can’t shake the feeling.
2000009911,boredom,Twitter is feeling dead… no wonder I haven’t been on here in ages.

2000009916,boredom,Can’t get to sleep tonight—just tossing and turning.
2000009917,boredom,Gogol Bordello show wasn’t as good as expected… maybe I’ll break out some old games instead.
2000009918,boredom,@Natalija Total drag—I know how you feel.
2000009919,boredom,Mega bored over here… nothing to do.

2000010274,boredom,"Really should have gone to Pisay… stuck here, bored out of my mind."
2000010275,boredom,Another day of filling out documents… can it get any more repetitive?
2000010276,boredom,"It’s late, and I’m still awake… why can’t I just sleep?"
2000010277,boredom,Think this study session has finally taken its toll—feeling totally wiped out.
2000010278,boredom,"RC maintenance is taking forever, and I’m out of things to do… the boredom is real."
2000010279,boredom,Could use literally anything to keep me busy right now—this boredom is no joke.
2000010280,boredom,It’s roasting in the office… an AC miracle would be amazing.
2000010281,boredom,Cleaning up the old apartment today… definitely not my favorite task.
2000010282,boredom,@memow That finale didn’t quite hit the mark for me… felt a bit cheap.
2000010283,boredom,Math class and still an hour to go till lunch… someone save me.
2000010284,boredom,"Trying to finish this assignment, but it feels like I’m hitting a wall."
2000010285,boredom,@MeanMillies Same here—bored out of my mind. Wish something exciting would happen!
2000010286,boredom,"Doesn’t matter how much I sleep, I still wake up feeling tired."
2000010287,boredom,"Weather is terrible, and I’m totally out of things to do… feels like the longest day ever."
2000010288,boredom,"Math hates me, and I’m convinced the feeling is mutual."
2000010289,boredom,Beyond bored… anyone out there who wants to chat?
2000010290,boredom,"Stuck in textiles class, and the clock is barely moving."
2000010291,boredom,"Moving day in the rain... just perfect timing, right? Goodbye, Hamptons!"
2000010292,boredom,Weekend isn’t looking promising… probably going to be a total snooze-fest.
2000010293,boredom,"Quick bite at work, then back to the stack of envelopes I have to address… wrist, prepare yourself."
2000010294,boredom,"YouTube isn’t loading, and all I wanted was to watch Britain’s Got Talent… guess it’s not my day."
2000010295,boredom,"@h269 Finals creeping up, and I’m deep into study mode… motivation is low."
2000010296,boredom,Too quiet without Bunny here… the place feels kind of empty.
2000010297,boredom,@KatherineLunt Wish I could dive into your book right now—would definitely help with this boredom.
2000010298,boredom,Bank teller was definitely giving me the “look”—not what I needed today.
2000010299,boredom,Trying to get back in the groove after that last deadline… it’s a struggle.
2000010300,boredom,"Spent way too much today, and now stuck on a long tube ride home to think about it."
2000010301,boredom,Wish I could just head home… this lonely work shift is no fun.
2000010302,boredom,"Beautiful day out, and I’m trapped in the office, missing all the sunshine."
2000010303,boredom,Could really use someone to talk to… boredom is getting intense.
2000010304,boredom,"Best friend’s busy, so I’m here alone with nothing to do… the struggle is real."
2000010305,boredom,Tired of feeling sick constantly… when does it end?
2000010306,boredom,Bus is crawling along… feels like I’ve been on here forever.
2000010307,boredom,Not feeling the love today… wish my guy would show a little more appreciation.
2000010308,boredom,Over an hour waiting… seriously losing patience here.
2000010309,boredom,"@shaveblog Without GPU support, Flash is just painful—HD video is out of the question."
2000010310,boredom,"Mrs. Fields cookies are calling my name, but the mall is so far… might bake instead."
2000010311,boredom,@BlueEyedGirl18 I’ve been waiting here over an hour… this is getting ridiculous.
2000010312,boredom,"Woke up feeling super lazy… should work out, but bed sounds better."
2000010313,boredom,@BOPandTigerBeat Missed the chat with the boys—first time I ever missed one!
2000010314,boredom,"Can’t believe I’m this tired, yet sleep just won’t come."
2000010315,boredom,Waiting in line forever… feels like it’s moving in slow motion.
2000010316,boredom,Already regretting this double shift decision—never again.
2000010317,boredom,So bored… might as well just call it an early night.
2000010318,boredom,This feeling is cutting deep… can’t get it out of my head.
2000010319,boredom,Twitter is a ghost town… now I remember why I stayed off for so long.
2000010320,boredom,Server errors every time I try to buy anything on the ovi store… seriously?
2000010321,boredom,Tweeting live from the tarmac at Cork Airport… delayed again.
2000010322,boredom,Can’t sleep and feeling queasy… great combo.
2000010323,boredom,"Friday at work, and everything is moving at a glacial pace."
2000010324,boredom,"Sleep isn’t happening tonight—thanks, insomnia."
2000010325,boredom,Not the best show I’ve seen… might just switch to gaming.
2000010326,boredom,@Natalija It’s rough… I know the feeling.
2000010327,boredom,Feeling incredibly bored… anyone got something interesting to share?
2000010328,boredom,"Last chemistry class of the year, finally! Birthday countdown begins."
2000010329,boredom,"My brother woke me up for homework help… sibling duty calls, I guess."
2000010330,boredom,"Day off, but got called in… plus the dentist and MRI later. What a day."
2000010331,boredom,Editing this video is draining me… should’ve reconsidered this project.
2000010332,boredom,"It’s gorgeous outside, and I’m just stuck here with nothing to do."
2000010333,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing is pure torture… wish I could avoid it entirely.
2000010334,boredom,Pisay would’ve been a better choice than sitting here bored out of my mind.
2000010335,boredom,Nothing but documentation all day… mind is going numb.
2000010336,boredom,"Late, and I’m still up… sleep would be nice right about now."
2000010337,boredom,All this studying is really getting to me—could use a long nap.
2000010338,boredom,RC maintenance means I’m stuck with nothing to do… wish it would hurry up.
2000010339,boredom,"Need something, anything, to distract me—boredom is real."
2000010340,boredom,Office is sweltering… some AC would be a lifesaver.
2000010341,boredom,Cleaning out the old apartment today… not what I planned for a day off.
2000010342,boredom,@memow Finale left me feeling disappointed… felt like a cheap ending.
2000010343,boredom,Math class with lunch just out of reach… can the clock move any slower?
2000010344,boredom,Trying to finish this assignment… feels like I’m moving through quicksand.
2000010345,boredom,@MeanMillies Total boredom over here—need something to brighten up the day.
2000010346,boredom,"Doesn’t matter how much rest I get, I still wake up feeling exhausted."
2000010347,boredom,Awful weather and absolutely nothing to do… today’s a drag.
2000010348,boredom,Math and I will never get along… it’s a one-sided feud.
2000010349,boredom,So bored… wish there was someone around to chat with.
2000010350,boredom,Textiles class feels like it’s going in slow motion… so ready for it to end.
2000010351,boredom,"Rain on moving day… because of course. Goodbye, Hamptons."
2000010352,boredom,"This weekend is looking so dull… no plans, no excitement."
2000010353,boredom,"Quick snack at work, then back to the mountain of envelopes… wrist, brace yourself."
2000010354,boredom,"YouTube won’t load, and I was all set to watch Britain’s Got Talent… time for plan B."
2000010355,boredom,"@h269 Finals creeping up fast, and I’m already feeling the burnout."
2000010356,boredom,Feels too empty here without Bunny… missing that little guy.
2000010357,boredom,@KatherineLunt Wish I could dive into your book right now—would make this boredom bearable.
2000010358,boredom,Got some serious looks from the bank teller… not my vibe today.
2000010359,boredom,Trying to get back into work mode after that last deadline… easier said than done.
2000010360,boredom,Spent way too much on today’s errands… tube ride home feels extra long.
2000010361,boredom,Wish I could just be home… working solo is seriously dull.
2000010362,boredom,"Such a gorgeous day outside, and I’m stuck here missing it all."
2000010363,boredom,Completely drained—wish I could just recharge for a week.
2000010364,boredom,"Stuck in this line, and it feels like time has stopped."
2000010365,boredom,Why did I agree to this double shift? Can’t believe I did this to myself.
2000010366,boredom,"At this level of boredom, bed is starting to look like the best option."
2000010367,boredom,"This is such a strange, deep ache… don’t know how to shake it off."
2000010368,boredom,"Logged into Twitter, and it’s as quiet as ever—no wonder I stayed away for so long."
2000010369,boredom,Ovi store checkout is glitching again… can’t buy a single thing.
2000010370,boredom,Delayed on the runway at Cork Airport… could really use a distraction right now.
2000010371,boredom,"Not feeling too well, and on top of it, I can’t sleep. Great combo."
2000010372,boredom,"Friday, and the work tubes are moving like molasses."
2000010373,boredom,No sleep in sight tonight… lying awake wondering why.
2000010374,boredom,That show was a letdown… might break out the video games to pass time.
2000010375,boredom,"@Natalija Yep, I totally get it… this really bites."
2000010376,boredom,Hit the wall of boredom… don’t even know what to do with myself.
2000010377,boredom,Goodbye chemistry class—done with it for the year! Now just counting down till my birthday.
2000010378,boredom,"My brother decided to wake me up for homework help… oh, sibling life."
2000010379,boredom,"So much for a “day off”… got called in, plus dentist and MRI ahead."
2000010380,boredom,This video edit is never-ending… already second-guessing it.
2000010381,boredom,"It’s absolutely beautiful outside, and I’m in here doing nothing at all."
2000010382,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing is the absolute worst… wish I could ignore it altogether.
2000010383,boredom,Kind of wish I’d just gone out to Pisay today instead of wasting away here.
2000010384,boredom,"All day, and it’s just been documentation… losing my mind over here."
2000010385,boredom,"Why am I still up? Sleep, please take me away from this boredom."
2000010386,boredom,This study grind is wearing me down—feels like I’m just going through the motions.
2000010387,boredom,RC down for maintenance and I’m left with nothing to do… sigh.
2000010388,boredom,Just want anything to do at this point—this boredom is unbearable.
2000010389,boredom,It’s so warm in here I feel like I’m melting… where’s the AC when you need it?
2000010390,boredom,Cleaning up the old apartment today… thrilling way to spend the day.
2000010391,boredom,@memow That finale was a total letdown… they could’ve done so much better.
2000010392,boredom,Math class drags on… waiting for lunch feels like forever.
2000010393,boredom,"Trying to get through this assignment, but my mind’s checked out."
2000010394,boredom,@MeanMillies Bored beyond belief… really could use a distraction.
2000010395,boredom,Doesn’t matter how long I sleep—always wake up tired.
2000010396,boredom,"It’s gray and dull outside, and I’m feeling as bored as ever."
2000010397,boredom,"Math is not my thing, and I’m sure math feels the same about me."
2000010398,boredom,Bored out of my mind… is there anyone to chat with?
2000010399,boredom,Sitting in textiles class and watching the clock tick down… so ready to leave.
2000010400,boredom,"Moving day plus rain… perfect combo, right? Goodbye, Hamptons."
2000010401,boredom,This weekend is looking so uneventful… need some excitement stat.
2000010402,boredom,"Taking a quick break, but then it’s back to addressing all these envelopes… wrist, don’t fail me."
2000010403,boredom,"YouTube’s down, and all I wanted was to watch Britain’s Got Talent… what a bummer."
2000010404,boredom,@h269 Buried under study notes with finals coming up fast. Wish I could fast-forward through this.
2000010405,boredom,It’s too empty here without Bunny… missing the little guy’s company.
2000010406,boredom,@KatherineLunt Would love to dive into your book right now… could use the escape.
2000010407,boredom,The teller at the bank was definitely giving me the look… but not my type.
2000010408,boredom,Trying to get back in the swing of things after that last project—motivation is lacking.
2000010409,boredom,"Overspent today, and now I’m regretting it on this long tube ride."
2000010410,boredom,Wish I could be anywhere but here… working alone is the worst.
2000010411,boredom,"The sun is shining outside, and I’m stuck here watching it from a window."
2000010412,boredom,Bored and feeling the weight of it… wish I had someone to chat with.
2000010413,boredom,"My best friend’s busy, so I’m left here with absolutely nothing to do."
2000010414,boredom,Sick and tired of always feeling under the weather… when will it end?
2000010415,boredom,This bus ride feels like it’s dragging on forever… losing track of time.
2000010416,boredom,Not feeling appreciated today… wish my partner would show a bit more love.
2000010417,boredom,Been waiting here for over an hour… patience wearing thin.
2000010418,boredom,@shaveblog Flash without GPU support is just unwatchable—HD isn’t even an option.
2000010419,boredom,"Craving some cookies, but the mall is too far… might just bake instead."
2000010420,boredom,@BlueEyedGirl18 Waiting forever… over an hour and still here.
2000010421,boredom,Woke up feeling super unmotivated… need to work out but not feeling it.
2000010422,boredom,@BOPandTigerBeat Missed the boys’ chat yesterday! First one I’ve ever missed!
2000010423,boredom,"Feeling beyond tired, and still sleep won’t come."
2000010424,boredom,This line isn’t moving… feels like it’s going on for miles.
2000010425,boredom,Already dreading the rest of this double shift—never again.
2000010426,boredom,Bored enough to call it a night and just sleep it off.
2000010427,boredom,"This feeling is intense, like it’s weighing down on me."
2000010428,boredom,"Logged back into Twitter, and it’s as dead as ever… wonder why I left?"
2000010429,boredom,Can’t complete a purchase on the ovi store… server errors nonstop.
2000010430,boredom,On the runway and delayed… wish I had something to pass the time.
2000010431,boredom,Restless and feeling nauseous… tonight is not my night.
2000010432,boredom,Everything feels slow-motion on Fridays… especially at work.
2000010433,boredom,Can’t fall asleep tonight—wondering why I even bothered to try.
2000010434,boredom,That Gogol Bordello show didn’t live up to the hype… maybe time for an old-school game.
2000010435,boredom,"@Natalija You’re right, it’s a serious bummer."
2000010436,boredom,Couldn’t be more bored if I tried… what’s everyone up to?
2000010437,boredom,Chemistry class is finally over for the year! Let the countdown to my birthday begin.
2000010438,boredom,My brother dragged me out of bed for homework help… gotta love sibling life.
2000010439,boredom,"Day off, yet work needed me in… and I’ve still got dentist and MRI later."
2000010440,boredom,This video edit is draining my soul… why did I start this?
2000010441,boredom,"Couldn’t be more perfect outside, and I’m in here with absolutely nothing to do."
2000010442,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing feels like punishment… would rather be doing anything else.
2000010443,boredom,Kind of regret not going to Pisay… this boredom is too much.
2000010444,boredom,Been staring at documents all day… going slightly mad over here.
2000010445,boredom,"It’s late, and I’m still wide awake… where’s sleep when you need it?"
2000010446,boredom,Feels like studying has turned me into a zombie… need a break.
2000010447,boredom,"RC is down, and I’m out of things to keep me busy… bored to tears."
2000010448,boredom,Could use a distraction of any kind—this boredom is all-consuming.
2000010449,boredom,Feels like a sauna in here… AC would be a lifesaver right now.
2000010450,boredom,Cleaning the old place today… definitely not how I wanted to spend my day.
2000010451,boredom,@memow That finale fell flat… expected more.
2000010452,boredom,Sitting in math class and waiting for lunch feels like an eternity.
2000010453,boredom,"Trying to finish this assignment, but my mind is totally blank."
2000010454,boredom,@MeanMillies So bored… need something fun to pass the time.
2000010455,boredom,"No matter how long I sleep, I’m still always tired."
2000010456,boredom,Gray skies and nothing to do… could this day be more dull?
2000010457,boredom,Math and I have a love-hate relationship… mostly hate.
2000010458,boredom,Mega bored over here… anyone down to chat?
2000010459,boredom,Textiles class feels endless today… watching the minutes tick by.
2000010460,boredom,"Moving day, and of course, it’s raining… goodbye, Hamptons!"
2000010461,boredom,This weekend is looking like it’ll be a dud… need some excitement.
2000010462,boredom,"Quick snack at work, then back to handwriting endless envelopes… poor wrist."
2000010463,boredom,"YouTube isn’t loading, and I wanted to watch Britain’s Got Talent… so over it."
2000010464,boredom,"@h269 Final exams are closing in, and I’m already burned out."
2000010465,boredom,The place feels empty without Bunny here… missing him a lot.
2000010466,boredom,@KatherineLunt Could really use your book to get me through this boredom.
2000010467,boredom,"Got the vibe from the bank teller, but not feeling it at all."
2000010468,boredom,Trying to bounce back into work mode after that deadline… tough day.
2000010469,boredom,"Spent too much on errands today, and now I’m stuck on a long ride home to reflect."
2000010470,boredom,Wish I could just head home… working solo is so lonely.
2000010471,boredom,"Beautiful weather outside, and I’m missing every second of it from in here."
2000010472,boredom,Could use some company right now… boredom is really setting in.
2000010473,boredom,Running on empty... could seriously use a week-long nap.
2000010474,boredom,Waiting in line forever… time feels like it’s standing still.
2000010475,boredom,Why did I agree to this double shift? I must’ve lost my mind.
2000010476,boredom,This day’s got nothing going on… might as well go to bed early.
2000010477,boredom,This feeling is deeper than I expected—just can’t shake it off.
2000010478,boredom,"Logged into Twitter, and wow, it’s still as dry as ever. Guess it’s been a while."
2000010479,boredom,"Trying to buy something on the ovi store, but the server is just not having it."
2000010480,boredom,Grounded on the tarmac at Cork Airport—guess we’re not going anywhere for a while.
2000010481,boredom,"Feeling all kinds of off, and sleep is nowhere in sight."
2000010482,boredom,Friday and the work tubes are crawling… slow day in every way.
2000010483,boredom,"Staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep… insomnia strikes again."
2000010484,boredom,This show didn’t deliver… maybe a game will make things interesting.
2000010485,boredom,@Natalija I totally relate—it’s painfully dull.
2000010486,boredom,Nothing but pure boredom here... don’t know what to do with myself.
2000010487,boredom,Chemistry classes are done for the year! At least that’s something to celebrate.
2000010488,boredom,Just got yanked out of sleep by my brother asking for help… not thrilled.
2000010489,boredom,"Day off? More like “work still needs me day.” Plus, dentist and MRI, because why not."
2000010490,boredom,Editing this video is taking forever… ready to be done already.
2000010491,boredom,"The weather’s so nice, and I’m here wasting away indoors."
2000010492,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing things is worse than watching paint dry… why am I doing this?
2000010493,boredom,Kind of regret not heading out to Pisay… would’ve been better than sitting here.
2000010494,boredom,"Another day, another document… I’m losing it."
2000010495,boredom,"Up late for no reason, just staring into space… sleep, where are you?"
2000010496,boredom,Studying is starting to make me feel like a robot on autopilot.
2000010497,boredom,"RC is in maintenance, and I’m sitting here with absolutely nothing to do."
2000010498,boredom,Anything to break this boredom right now would be a miracle.
2000010499,boredom,Office is way too warm—seriously in need of some AC here.
2000010500,boredom,Cleaning out the old place today… thrilling way to spend my day.
2000010501,boredom,@memow That finale was just disappointing… they could’ve done so much more with it.
2000010502,boredom,"Math class, and the lunch break feels light-years away."
2000010503,boredom,"Trying to finish this assignment, but I’m just hitting a wall."
2000010504,boredom,"@MeanMillies Super bored over here… seriously, something needs to happen."
2000010505,boredom,No amount of sleep ever seems to make a difference… always tired.
2000010506,boredom,"Cloudy, dull day, and I’m right there with it—feeling totally blah."
2000010507,boredom,Math and I are just not a match… not even a little.
2000010508,boredom,Running out of things to do… anyone out there want to chat?
2000010509,boredom,"Sitting in textiles class, and time feels like it’s moving backward."
2000010510,boredom,"Moving day in the rain… because of course, it just had to rain."
2000010511,boredom,This weekend is looking like it’ll be one big yawn.
2000010512,boredom,"Quick bite at work, then back to addressing endless envelopes… oh, joy."
2000010513,boredom,"YouTube won’t load, and I was set on watching Britain’s Got Talent… great."
2000010514,boredom,"@h269 Knee-deep in finals prep, and I’m already over it."
2000010515,boredom,Feels like something’s missing here without Bunny around… too quiet.
2000010516,boredom,@KatherineLunt I’d give anything for your book right now… it’d help with this boredom.
2000010517,boredom,Bank teller definitely gave me the eye… but not interested today.
2000010518,boredom,Trying to jump back into work mode after a project is harder than I thought.
2000010519,boredom,Spent more than planned today… got a long ride home to think about it.
2000010520,boredom,Wish I could be anywhere but here—working alone is no fun.
2000010521,boredom,"The sun is shining, and I’m missing it all while sitting here inside."
2000010522,boredom,Could use a conversation right about now… boredom is intense.
2000010523,boredom,"Best friend’s tied up, so I’m stuck here with zero plans."
2000010524,boredom,Always sick and tired of being sick and tired… when does it end?
2000010525,boredom,This bus ride is moving at a crawl… feels like I’ve been here forever.
2000010526,boredom,Not really feeling the love today… could use some appreciation.
2000010527,boredom,"Over an hour waiting, and I’m running out of patience."
2000010528,boredom,@shaveblog Watching Flash without GPU support is painful—can’t even stream HD.
2000010529,boredom,"Mrs. Fields cookies sound amazing right now, but the mall is so far… might just bake."
2000010530,boredom,@BlueEyedGirl18 Still here waiting… over an hour of this nonsense.
2000010531,boredom,Woke up feeling lazy… need to work out but don’t feel like moving.
2000010532,boredom,@BOPandTigerBeat First chat I’ve missed… sad I wasn’t there yesterday.
2000010533,boredom,"So tired, yet still awake… it’s a strange kind of torture."
2000010534,boredom,This line is never-ending… wonder if I’ll be here forever.
2000010535,boredom,Already second-guessing this double shift… why did I agree to it?
2000010536,boredom,So bored I might just turn in early… what’s the point of staying up?
2000010537,boredom,This feeling is deep… almost like a heavy weight that won’t go away.
2000010538,boredom,Twitter feels like a ghost town… why did I bother coming back?
2000010539,boredom,"Trying to check out on ovi store, but it keeps failing… I give up."
2000010540,boredom,Still grounded on the tarmac… looks like we’re stuck here for a while.
2000010541,boredom,Nauseous and restless… just want this night to be over.
2000010542,boredom,Fridays at work are always the slowest… today’s no exception.
2000010543,boredom,"Trying to sleep, but it’s just not happening tonight."
2000010544,boredom,That show was underwhelming… maybe some old-school games will lift my mood.
2000010545,boredom,@Natalija Hang in there… I’m feeling the exact same way.
2000010546,boredom,Pure boredom over here… what’s everyone else up to?
2000010547,boredom,Finally done with chemistry… can’t wait for my birthday now.
2000010548,boredom,Just got woken up by my brother needing homework help… not happy about it.
2000010549,boredom,"Supposed to be a day off, but here I am working again… dentist and MRI up next."
2000010550,boredom,Editing this video feels like an eternity… already second-guessing it.
2000010551,boredom,"The weather’s amazing outside, and I’m here doing nothing."
2000010552,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing things away feels like the ultimate waste of time… need a break.
2000010553,boredom,Should’ve gone to Pisay… anything’s better than this boredom.
2000010554,boredom,"Documentation, documentation, and more documentation… it’s endless."
2000010555,boredom,"Why am I still awake? Sleep, I need you now."
2000010556,boredom,Feeling like a study robot… need something to break the routine.
2000010557,boredom,"RC is down, and I’m out of things to keep me busy."
2000010558,boredom,"Wish I had something, anything to break up this boredom."
2000010559,boredom,Feels like a sauna in here… an AC would be a blessing right now.
2000010560,boredom,Cleaning the old place today… not exactly my idea of a fun day.
2000010561,boredom,@memow That ending was so underwhelming… thought it’d be better.
2000010562,boredom,In math class waiting for the clock to hit lunch… time is dragging.
2000010563,boredom,"Trying to finish this, but my mind’s all over the place."
2000010564,boredom,@MeanMillies Totally bored… wish something exciting would happen!
2000010565,boredom,"No matter how much I sleep, I wake up feeling like I need more."
2000010566,boredom,"Weather’s blah, and I’m feeling just as blah… could this day go any slower?"
2000010567,boredom,Math and I will never be on good terms… it’s like we’re enemies.
2000010568,boredom,Desperately need something to do… anyone up for a chat?
2000010569,boredom,"Stuck in textiles class, and time is crawling."
2000010570,boredom,"Moving day and, of course, it’s raining. Goodbye, Hamptons."
2000010571,boredom,Not expecting much from this weekend… looks like it’ll be a bore-fest.
2000010572,boredom,"Quick break at work, then back to my pile of envelopes… thrilling stuff."
2000010573,boredom,"YouTube isn’t working, and I was looking forward to Britain’s Got Talent… what now?"
2000010574,boredom,@h269 Drowning in study notes… finals are looming closer every day.
2000010575,boredom,Too quiet without Bunny around… missing the little guy.
2000010576,boredom,@KatherineLunt Wish I had your book to get me through this boredom.
2000010577,boredom,"The bank teller seemed interested, but I’m just not in the mood."
2000010578,boredom,Trying to bounce back after that deadline… tough to find motivation.
2000010579,boredom,Spent more than planned today… nothing like a long ride home to reflect on it.
2000010580,boredom,Wish I was anywhere but here… working alone is no fun at all.
2000010581,boredom,"It’s a beautiful day outside, and I’m here missing all of it."
2000010582,boredom,Running on fumes—need a serious recharge.
2000010583,boredom,Standing in line for what feels like a lifetime… are we even moving?
2000010584,boredom,A double shift? I must have lost all sense… this is a rough one.
2000010585,boredom,"This day is so empty, I might just call it early and hit the pillow."
2000010586,boredom,This feeling… it’s like a weight I can’t lift off.
2000010587,boredom,"Checked Twitter, and it’s as quiet as a library—guess I’ve been away for good reason."
2000010588,boredom,Ovi store keeps glitching at checkout… just take my money already!
2000010589,boredom,Delayed on the tarmac—wish I’d brought more snacks.
2000010590,boredom,Feeling off and can’t rest… nothing worse than a restless night.
2000010591,boredom,Fridays at work feel like they’re running on half-speed.
2000010592,boredom,Lying here wide awake when I should be asleep—why can’t I just knock out?
2000010593,boredom,That show didn’t hit the spot… maybe some old-school gaming will.
2000010594,boredom,"@Natalija Yep, I get it… this whole day feels like a dud."
2000010595,boredom,There’s absolutely nothing going on… boredom levels off the charts.
2000010596,boredom,Goodbye chemistry class… see you never! Birthday is the next big thing.
2000010597,boredom,"Just got dragged out of bed for a little homework help… thanks, bro."
2000010598,boredom,"Day off? Not exactly… got called in, and there’s still the dentist and MRI later."
2000010599,boredom,This video editing is taking forever… how did I get myself into this?
2000010600,boredom,"It’s gorgeous outside, and here I am, stuck indoors with nothing to do."
2000010601,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing feels like a never-ending cycle… someone save me from this.
2000010602,boredom,Should’ve gone out… sitting here feels like I’m just wasting time.
2000010603,boredom,Another day lost to endless documents… my brain is on auto-pilot.
2000010604,boredom,"It’s late, I’m still up, and sleep feels like a distant dream."
2000010605,boredom,Studying has me feeling like a machine—just going through the motions.
2000010606,boredom,"RC is down, and boredom is taking over… could really use a distraction."
2000010607,boredom,Could use anything right now to break up this boredom… anyone got ideas?
2000010608,boredom,Feels like a mini heatwave in the office… when’s the AC going to kick in?
2000010609,boredom,"Cleaning out the old apartment… thrilling way to spend the day, right?"
2000010610,boredom,@memow Finale didn’t do it for me… really hoped for something more.
2000010611,boredom,Math class… and lunch couldn’t feel further away.
2000010612,boredom,"Trying to finish this assignment, but I’m hitting a wall."
2000010613,boredom,"@MeanMillies Need something to wake me up… seriously, boredom is winning."
2000010614,boredom,"Doesn’t matter how much I sleep, I’m always tired when I wake up."
2000010615,boredom,"Weather’s dull, and so am I… could use a little spark today."
2000010616,boredom,Math is my eternal frenemy… and I think it’s winning today.
2000010617,boredom,So bored it hurts… anyone around for a chat?
2000010618,boredom,"Stuck in textiles, and time feels like it’s at a standstill."
2000010619,boredom,Moving day in the rain… it just had to pour. Classic timing.
2000010620,boredom,Looking at this weekend and not seeing much excitement.
2000010621,boredom,"Taking a break, then back to addressing these endless envelopes… wrist pain incoming."
2000010622,boredom,"YouTube isn’t working, and I was so ready to watch Britain’s Got Talent… just my luck."
2000010623,boredom,"@h269 Finals mode activated, and I’m already feeling burned out."
2000010624,boredom,It’s way too quiet here without Bunny… feels like something’s missing.
2000010625,boredom,@KatherineLunt I need your book right now… anything to escape this boredom.
2000010626,boredom,The teller was definitely giving me looks… but today’s not the day for that.
2000010627,boredom,"Back to work mode after a big deadline… motivation, where are you?"
2000010628,boredom,Spent more than planned… got a long tube ride home to think about it.
2000010629,boredom,Wish I could just head home… being here alone is just depressing.
2000010630,boredom,"The sun is calling, and I’m here, stuck inside."
2000010631,boredom,Could use a little company… boredom is seriously creeping in.
2000010632,boredom,"Best friend’s got plans, so I’m here twiddling my thumbs."
2000010633,boredom,Sick and tired of feeling sick and tired… wish this cycle would end.
2000010634,boredom,This bus ride feels like a slow-motion movie… will we ever get there?
2000010635,boredom,Not feeling the love today… would be nice to feel a bit more appreciated.
2000010636,boredom,Over an hour of waiting… patience is reaching its limit.
2000010637,boredom,@shaveblog Watching HD on Flash with no GPU support is a nightmare.
2000010638,boredom,"Craving Mrs. Fields, but the mall feels like it’s a world away… maybe I’ll bake instead."
2000010639,boredom,@BlueEyedGirl18 Waiting for what seems like forever… over an hour and counting.
2000010640,boredom,"Lazy vibes this morning… should work out, but motivation is at rock bottom."
2000010641,boredom,@BOPandTigerBeat Missed the chat yesterday—first time I haven’t been there!
2000010642,boredom,"Tired beyond belief, yet somehow still wide awake."
2000010643,boredom,In line forever… wish this line would just move already!
2000010644,boredom,Already feeling like this double shift was a bad call.
2000010645,boredom,"Nothing to do, nowhere to go… might as well just turn in early."
2000010646,boredom,This feels like a weight I can’t shake off.
2000010647,boredom,"Came back to Twitter, and it’s as quiet as ever… guess I wasn’t missing much."
2000010648,boredom,"Tried to check out on the ovi store, but all I get are server errors."
2000010649,boredom,Still grounded on the tarmac… just waiting for a miracle at this point.
2000010650,boredom,"Nauseous and can’t sleep… not my best night, that’s for sure."
2000010651,boredom,"Friday vibes at work, and it’s like time is on slow-motion."
2000010652,boredom,Can’t seem to sleep tonight… just lying here awake.
2000010653,boredom,Show didn’t live up to the hype… might just play something to pass the time.
2000010654,boredom,@Natalija Same here—it’s been a total drag today.
2000010655,boredom,"Bored beyond belief… seriously, what’s everyone else up to?"
2000010656,boredom,"Chemistry class is finally over… next stop, birthday!"
2000010657,boredom,"Got woken up for homework help… brotherly duty, I guess."
2000010658,boredom,"Called in on my day off… plus, the dentist and MRI await. What a “break.”"
2000010659,boredom,This video project is a grind… already regretting it.
2000010660,boredom,"Beautiful outside, and I’m here missing out on everything."
2000010661,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing things away is mind-numbing… wish I could be anywhere else.
2000010662,boredom,Wondering if I should’ve gone to Pisay… this is painfully boring.
2000010663,boredom,Document after document… brain is officially fried.
2000010664,boredom,"It’s late, and I’m wide awake… sleep, where are you?"
2000010665,boredom,Study mode has officially turned me into a zombie… need a recharge.
2000010666,boredom,Nothing to do since RC is down… bored to pieces over here.
2000010667,boredom,"Could really use something, anything to break this boredom… any ideas?"
2000010668,boredom,"Feels like I’m roasting in here… AC, where are you?"
2000010669,boredom,Spent my day cleaning out the old place… the definition of thrilling.
2000010670,boredom,@memow That ending was a letdown… had higher hopes.
2000010671,boredom,Math class with lunch just out of reach… this is torture.
2000010672,boredom,"Trying to power through this assignment, but my mind is a blank slate."
2000010673,boredom,@MeanMillies Seriously bored… wish I could hit “refresh” on this day.
2000010674,boredom,Doesn’t matter how much I sleep—always wake up feeling tired.
2000010675,boredom,"Gray skies, dull vibes… and I’m right there with it."
2000010676,boredom,Math is not my friend today… more like my sworn enemy.
2000010677,boredom,Officially bored out of my mind… anyone around to chat?
2000010678,boredom,Textiles class feels like it’s on repeat… just want it to end already.
2000010679,boredom,"Moving day and, of course, it’s raining. Goodbye, Hamptons!"
2000010680,boredom,This weekend is shaping up to be a major snooze-fest.
2000010681,boredom,"Quick snack at work, then back to addressing endless envelopes… wrist, prepare yourself."
2000010682,boredom,"YouTube isn’t loading, and I was all set for Britain’s Got Talent… oh well."
2000010683,boredom,@h269 Final exam prep is wearing me out… just trying to hang on here.
2000010684,boredom,Feels too empty here without Bunny… missing the little guy.
2000010685,boredom,@KatherineLunt Would love to escape into your book right now… boredom central here.
2000010686,boredom,Bank teller gave me a few looks… but I’m just not feeling it today.
2000010687,boredom,"Trying to get back into work mode, but my energy is at zero."
2000010688,boredom,Spent way too much today… got a long ride home to reflect on my choices.
2000010689,boredom,Wish I could be home right now… working solo is no fun.
2000010690,boredom,"Beautiful weather outside, and I’m here watching it from a window."
2000010691,boredom,Could really use someone to chat with… boredom is winning today.
2000010692,boredom,Not sure how I got roped into this double shift... barely surviving here.
2000010693,boredom,"Stuck here, waiting, and it feels like time has slowed to a crawl."
2000010694,boredom,This day feels like it has nothing going for it… early bed sounds tempting.
2000010695,boredom,"That feeling when you’re just drained and tired, and it won’t go away."
2000010696,boredom,"Checked back on Twitter, and it’s just as quiet as I remembered... guess I wasn’t missing much."
2000010697,boredom,Still can’t check out on the ovi store... server errors are killing me here.
2000010698,boredom,Grounded on the tarmac at Cork Airport... waiting for a miracle or at least some movement.
2000010699,boredom,"Feeling kinda off tonight, can’t rest... and now sleep seems impossible."
2000010700,boredom,Work is dragging like molasses… why is everything slower on a Friday?
2000010701,boredom,Wide awake when I should be out like a light—insomnia isn’t my friend.
2000010702,boredom,That show was a flop… maybe a game will be more interesting.
2000010703,boredom,@Natalija I’m feeling you—it’s one of those days that feels like a complete drag.
2000010704,boredom,Totally out of things to do… what’s everyone else up to?
2000010705,boredom,Finally done with chemistry for the year… now just waiting on my birthday!
2000010706,boredom,"Got dragged out of bed by my brother asking for help… sibling duty, I guess."
2000010707,boredom,"Day off? Not really, since I’m working again today… and still have to hit the dentist."
2000010708,boredom,This video project feels like it’s never-ending… should’ve reconsidered it.
2000010709,boredom,"The weather’s amazing outside, and I’m stuck here doing nothing indoors."
2000010710,boredom,@solobasssteve Filing things away is the dullest job… why do I have to do this?
2000010711,boredom,Really should’ve gone to Pisay… anything’s better than sitting here bored.
2000010712,boredom,"Another day, more documentation… brain feels like it’s in sleep mode."
2000010713,boredom,Why am I still up this late? Sleep would be a gift right now.
2000010714,boredom,All this studying has turned me into a robot on autopilot.
2000010715,boredom,"RC is down, and now I’m completely out of things to do... bored stiff."
2000010716,boredom,Could use a distraction right now—anything to break up this boredom.
2000010717,boredom,Office is feeling like a sauna… AC would be amazing right now.
2000010718,boredom,Spent the day cleaning out the old apartment… not exactly fun.
2000010719,boredom,"@memow That finale was a letdown… expected a little more action, honestly."
2000010720,boredom,"Sitting in math, and the clock feels frozen… still waiting on lunch."
2000010721,boredom,"Trying to power through this assignment, but I’m blanking out."
2000010722,boredom,@MeanMillies Need something to wake me up… this boredom is overwhelming.
2000010723,boredom,"Doesn’t matter how much I rest, I still wake up exhausted."
2000010724,boredom,"Gray and gloomy outside, and I’m right there with it… could use a spark today."
2000010725,boredom,Math is the ultimate frenemy… it’s a love-hate relationship leaning toward hate.
2000010726,boredom,Beyond bored over here… anyone around to talk?
2000010727,boredom,"Sitting in textiles, and it feels like time is dragging slower than usual."
2000010728,boredom,"Moving day in the rain… of course, it just had to rain."
2000010729,boredom,Looking at the weekend ahead and not feeling inspired… needs more action.
2000010730,boredom,"Taking a quick work break, then back to the endless pile of envelopes… yay."
2000010731,boredom,"YouTube isn’t working, and I just wanted to catch Britain’s Got Talent… of course."
2000010732,boredom,"@h269 Buried in study notes with finals right around the corner… motivation, come find me."
2000010733,boredom,Way too quiet without Bunny here… it’s just not the same.
2000010734,boredom,@KatherineLunt Wish I had your book right now… something to break this boredom would be great.
2000010735,boredom,"The bank teller was giving me the eye, but I’m not really in the mood for it today."
2000010736,boredom,Trying to snap back to work after that deadline… motivation is lacking.
2000010737,boredom,Spent way too much on errands today… now stuck on a long ride home with my thoughts.
2000010738,boredom,Would rather be anywhere but here… working solo is no fun at all.
2000010739,boredom,"The sun is shining, and here I am, missing every second of it."
2000010740,boredom,Could use some company right now… boredom is starting to take over.
2000010741,boredom,"My best friend’s busy, so I’m here, feeling like a bump on a log."
2000010742,boredom,Sick and tired of feeling sick and tired… this cycle is old.
2000010743,boredom,This bus ride feels like it’s in slow motion… wish we’d hurry up.
2000010744,boredom,Not feeling appreciated today… a little love would go a long way.
2000010745,boredom,Been waiting here over an hour… running out of patience fast.
2000010746,boredom,@shaveblog Watching HD on Flash without GPU support is like torture.
2000010747,boredom,"Craving Mrs. Fields cookies, but the mall feels like it’s a world away… maybe I’ll just bake."
2000010748,boredom,"@BlueEyedGirl18 Still waiting, still stuck… over an hour now, and counting."
2000010749,boredom,"Lazy morning… I should work out, but the bed is calling my name."
2000010750,boredom,@BOPandTigerBeat First time missing the boys’ chat… sad about it!
2000010751,boredom,Exhausted but still awake… how does that even work?
2000010752,boredom,Line’s barely moving… feels like I’ve been here all day.
2000010753,boredom,Already regretting this double shift—who thought this was a good idea?
2000010754,boredom,"Nothing to do, nowhere to go… might as well just turn in early."
2000010755,boredom,This feels like a heavy weight I can’t shake.
2000010756,boredom,"Came back to Twitter, and it’s still as empty as ever… wonder why I stayed away?"

2000010967,boredom,"New shoes, but this rain means they’re staying in the box for now."

2000011755,boredom,Staring at my ceiling… not much else to do.
2000011756,boredom,Wishing for something exciting to break up this day.
2000011757,boredom,Time is standing still… bored out of my mind.
2000011758,boredom,Just waiting… and waiting… and waiting…
2000011759,boredom,"Nothing happening today, just me, myself, and boredom."
2000011760,boredom,I’m officially out of things to do… boredom is winning.
2000011761,boredom,"Stuck in the same place, doing nothing… could use some excitement."
2000011762,boredom,Absolutely nothing going on… need something to do.
2000011763,boredom,Counting ceiling tiles… that’s where my boredom is at right now.
2000011764,boredom,"Wishing the day would hurry up and end… so, so bored."
2000011765,boredom,Looking for any kind of distraction… today is painfully dull.
2000011766,boredom,Why is everything so boring today?
2000011767,boredom,"Lying around, waiting for the day to end… nothing happening."
2000011768,boredom,Today has been one long stretch of nothingness.
2000011769,boredom,"Trying to think of something to do, but I’m out of ideas."
2000011770,boredom,I need something to break up this monotony… it’s unbearable.
2000011771,boredom,This silence is starting to get to me… need something to do.
2000011772,boredom,"Bored out of my mind, with nowhere to go and nothing to do."
2000011773,boredom,"Staring out the window, watching time go by so slowly."
2000011774,boredom,"Just sitting here, waiting for the clock to move."
2000011775,boredom,"Nothing planned, nowhere to go… just stuck here."
2000011776,boredom,Feeling like I’m in a loop of boredom.
2000011777,boredom,Sigh… it’s just one of those painfully slow days.
2000011778,boredom,"I’ve done everything there is to do, and I’m still bored."
2000011779,boredom,So bored that even the idea of cleaning sounds appealing.
2000011780,boredom,Today is just dragging on and on… nothing happening.
2000011781,boredom,Feeling restless and stuck in this boredom.
2000011782,boredom,"Could really use something, anything, to break up this day."
2000011783,boredom,Checking my phone for the hundredth time… still nothing.
2000011784,boredom,"This has been the longest, dullest day."
2000011785,boredom,It’s so quiet… I’m going out of my mind with boredom.
2000011786,boredom,"Trying to find something fun to do, but coming up empty."
2000011787,boredom,Another day of nothing interesting happening.
2000011788,boredom,"Just pacing around, hoping for something exciting to come up."
2000011789,boredom,"Another hour, another round of nothing to do."
2000011790,boredom,"Watching the minutes pass, bored out of my mind."
2000011791,boredom,"Just scrolling, hoping for anything new… but nothing."
2000011792,boredom,Staring blankly ahead… boredom has fully taken over.
2000011793,boredom,Today has been nothing but waiting and waiting.
2000011794,boredom,"Looking around, wishing there was something to keep me busy."
2000011795,boredom,This day is one long stretch of dullness.
2000011796,boredom,"The boredom is real, and there’s no end in sight."
2000011797,boredom,"Nothing’s happening, and it feels like it never will."
2000011798,boredom,Could really use a change of scenery right about now.
2000011799,boredom,Nothing left to do but wait for the day to end.
2000011800,boredom,"Trying to keep myself entertained, but it’s not working."
2000011801,boredom,"Just sitting around, waiting for the next thing to happen."
2000011802,boredom,"Stuck in a rut of boredom, and it’s getting old."
2000011803,boredom,Not sure how much longer I can take this silence.
2000011804,boredom,"So bored, it feels like time has stopped."
2000011805,boredom,Looking at the clock again… why is it moving so slowly?
2000011806,boredom,"Just lying here, feeling completely bored."
2000011807,boredom,"Nothing new, nothing happening… it’s just me and the silence."
2000011808,boredom,Feeling like I’m in a never-ending loop of boredom.
2000011809,boredom,Every minute drags by… just me and my thoughts.
2000011810,boredom,So quiet that it’s almost eerie… where’s the excitement?
2000011811,boredom,"Wondering when the day will pick up… because right now, it’s a snooze."
2000011812,boredom,"I’ve done everything there is to do, and now I’m back to square one."
2000011813,boredom,Bored to the point that even staring out the window is something.
2000011814,boredom,Nothing left to do… boredom has officially won.
2000011815,boredom,Another hour of absolutely nothing happening.
2000011816,boredom,"Waiting for the day to end, but it feels like it never will."
2000011817,boredom,Scrolling through the same old feeds… nothing new.
2000011818,boredom,"Trying to think of ways to pass the time, but coming up empty."
2000011819,boredom,"This day is endless, and the boredom is real."
2000011820,boredom,"Looking for something, anything, to shake things up."
2000011821,boredom,Today feels like a repeat of yesterday… so bored.
2000011822,boredom,"Nothing happening, and it’s starting to feel suffocating."
2000011823,boredom,"Just lying around, counting the minutes."
2000011824,boredom,This day has been nothing but waiting and waiting.
2000011825,boredom,"Another round of boredom, with nothing on the horizon."
2000011826,boredom,The quiet is almost deafening… need some action.
2000011827,boredom,Today is moving in slow motion… boredom has taken over.
2000011828,boredom,Just me and my thoughts… need something to break this silence.
2000011829,boredom,"Hoping for something to happen, but it’s all just stillness."
2000011830,boredom,So tired of sitting around with nothing to do.
2000011831,boredom,Every second feels like an hour… boredom is brutal.
2000011832,boredom,I’ve refreshed my phone too many times… still nothing new.
2000011833,boredom,"Watching time pass, hoping the day picks up."
2000011834,boredom,"Nothing planned, nothing to do… it’s all so quiet."
2000011835,boredom,"Just sitting here, feeling like I’m in a time warp of boredom."
2000011836,boredom,"Wishing something, anything, would change."
2000011837,boredom,This day feels like an endless loop of nothingness.
2000011838,boredom,Feeling like I’m stuck in a void of boredom.
2000011839,boredom,Could use a spark of excitement right about now.
2000011840,boredom,Counting down the hours till I can call it a day.
2000011841,boredom,"Nothing going on, and it’s starting to get to me."
2000011842,boredom,"Wishing there was something, anything, to shake up this day."
2000011843,boredom,Scrolling endlessly… even my phone isn’t helping today.
2000011844,boredom,"This day is painfully slow, with no end in sight."
2000011845,boredom,Nothing but silence… need a break from this boredom.
2000011846,boredom,"Feeling restless, like I’m trapped in boredom."
2000011847,boredom,Today is a total snooze-fest.
2000011848,boredom,"Looking for something to keep my mind busy, but no luck."
2000011849,boredom,Time is dragging… this boredom feels endless.
2000011850,boredom,Just waiting for the day to end… nothing’s happening.
2000011851,boredom,"It’s just me, the quiet, and a whole lot of boredom."
2000011852,boredom,Wishing I could find something to pass the time.
2000011853,boredom,This day is moving at a snail’s pace… need some action.
2000011854,boredom,"Looking around, hoping for some excitement."
2000011855,boredom,"Stuck in the same spot, doing absolutely nothing."
2000011856,boredom,Bored to the point that I’m counting the seconds.
2000011857,boredom,Wondering how much longer I can take this endless quiet.
2000011858,boredom,Today feels like it’s moving in slow motion.
2000011859,boredom,"Just lying here, waiting for anything to happen."
2000011860,boredom,Could really use a distraction from this boredom.
2000011861,boredom,"Another minute passes, and it’s just me and the silence."
2000011862,boredom,Nothing on the horizon… just another slow day.
2000011863,boredom,Counting down until I can finally call it a day.

2000012744,anger,Another “quick errand” turned into an all-day ordeal.
2000012745,anger,Missed the bus by seconds. Could this day get worse?
2000012746,anger,"Got all the way there, and it’s closed. Thanks for nothing."

2000012844,anger,"Hyped myself up for this, and it’s a complete flop."
2000012845,anger,Nothing but issues all day long. I’m exhausted.
2000012846,anger,Plans canceled last minute AGAIN. Why do I even try?
2000012847,anger,"Phone’s on 1%, and of course, I left my charger."

2000012858,anger,"The power went out, and I’m left in the dark—literally and figuratively."
2000012859,anger,"Tried to relax, but life won’t give me a break."
2000012860,anger,"Nothing is going as planned, and it’s infuriating."
2000012861,anger,Why do things break down right when you need them?
2000012862,anger,This day has been a complete waste of time.
2000012863,anger,"Finally got free time, and nothing’s going my way."
2000012864,anger,I just want one thing to go right today. Is that too much to ask?
2000012865,anger,Every app on my phone is crashing—beyond annoyed.
2000012866,anger,"Thought I’d have a chill day, but it’s been one disaster after another."
2000012867,anger,"Set up for a cozy night, and my internet’s out. Fantastic."
2000012868,anger,Every single task today is turning into a nightmare.
2000012869,anger,"Had one goal today, and even that’s gone wrong."
2000012870,anger,"Wanted to go out, but now everything’s canceled."
2000012871,anger,"Got up for an early start, and everything’s falling apart."
2000012872,anger,"Had plans all set, and they just got canceled. Again."
2000012873,anger,My day was going fine until this disaster hit.
2000012874,anger,"Every time I get close to finishing, something ruins it."
2000012875,anger,"Packed for a trip, and now my flight’s delayed."
2000012876,anger,"Spent time organizing everything, and now it’s chaos again."
2000012877,anger,"Waited in line for an hour, and now they’re closed. Unbelievable."
2000012878,anger,My phone is acting up when I need it the most.
2000012879,anger,Everything I’ve planned today has gone wrong.
2000012880,anger,Just spilled coffee all over my desk. Great start.
2000012881,anger,Lost my only copy of an important document. Furious.
2000012882,anger,"Wanted a relaxing day, but that’s clearly not happening."
2000012883,anger,Every errand has turned into an ordeal. I’m over it.
2000012884,anger,Missed breakfast because someone else made me late.
2000012885,anger,The entire day feels like a waste.
2000012886,anger,"Got ready to go out, but now it’s pouring rain."
2000012887,anger,"Woke up with a plan, and everything’s ruined already."
2000012888,anger,"Waited forever for this package, and it’s damaged."
2000012889,anger,"Paid a ton for an event, and it was a complete letdown."
2000012890,anger,"Trying to focus, but distractions won’t stop."
2000012891,anger,"Set aside time for myself, and now everyone’s bothering me."
2000012892,anger,All my plans fell through at the last minute. Sick of this.
2000012893,anger,"Needed to relax, but today has other ideas."
2000012894,anger,"Trying to finish one thing, and a hundred things interrupt me."
2000012895,anger,Nothing I wanted to do today is working out.
2000012896,anger,Left the house and forgot everything I needed.
2000012897,anger,"Spent hours on something, only to have it fail."
2000012898,anger,"Trying to listen to music, and my headphones just died."
2000012899,anger,Every little detail today is going wrong.
2000012900,anger,"Trying to be productive, but everything’s falling apart."
2000012901,anger,This whole day feels like a waste of energy.
2000012902,anger,"Thought I’d get a break today, but it’s endless issues."
2000012903,anger,"Left my lunch at home, and now I’m starving."
2000012904,anger,"Waited weeks for this, and it’s a complete disappointment."
2000012905,anger,"Finally have a moment to myself, and it’s being interrupted."
2000012906,anger,This line hasn’t moved in ages. Losing my mind here.
2000012907,anger,"Was all set to work out, and now the gym’s closed."
2000012908,anger,"Wanted to watch a movie, and the DVD’s scratched."
2000012909,anger,"Paid for express delivery, and it’s still not here."
2000012910,anger,"Spent the whole day on this project, and it’s ruined."
2000012911,anger,"Was ready to go out, and now I’ve lost my keys."
2000012912,anger,Plans canceled again. Why do I even bother?
2000012913,anger,"Set everything up, and it’s still a disaster."
2000012914,anger,"All dressed up, and now I have nowhere to go."
2000012915,anger,"Trying to have a nice day, but everything’s going wrong."
2000012916,anger,"Finally sat down to work, and now my computer’s dead."
2000012917,anger,Missed an important call because my phone didn’t ring.
2000012918,anger,Can’t catch a break today—everything’s a mess.
2000012919,anger,"Why is it that every time I plan something, it falls apart?"
2000012920,anger,"Thought I’d have a chill evening, but it’s nothing but chaos."
2000012921,anger,"Paid extra for something special, and it’s totally wrong."
2000012922,anger,"Trying to finish up, and there’s a new issue every second."
2000012923,anger,Left my bag on the bus—great way to end the day.
2000012924,anger,"Got ready for an event, and it’s canceled. Perfect."
2000012925,anger,"All set for my workout, and I left my shoes at home."
2000012926,anger,"Plans ruined, patience gone. Done with today."
2000012927,anger,"Trying to stay calm, but everything’s testing me."
2000012928,anger,"Waited for this forever, and it’s totally underwhelming."
2000012929,anger,"Finally got a moment, and the Wi-Fi is out again."
2000012930,anger,"Trying to get home, and traffic is a nightmare."
2000012931,anger,Lost my wallet on the way to the store. Unbelievable.
2000012932,anger,"Every time I try to finish, there’s a new distraction."
2000012933,anger,"Thought I’d finally get things done, but no."
2000012934,anger,"Got all the way to the airport, and my flight’s canceled."
2000012935,anger,"Trying to stay positive, but today is just relentless."
2000012936,anger,"Planned everything perfectly, and it’s all gone wrong."
2000012937,anger,"Got ready for the day, and now it’s falling apart."
2000012938,anger,How many times do I have to deal with this internet nightmare?! I’m DONE.
2000012939,anger,I’m over it. Nothing EVER goes right for me.
2000012940,anger,"Packed and ready to go, only for this whole thing to fall apart. Unreal."
2000012941,anger,What’s the point of even trying when EVERYTHING backfires?
2000012942,anger,One day without issues—can I get that? Just once?!
2000012943,anger,Done with this garbage! Every plan I make just falls to pieces.
2000012944,anger,"@username I swear, if this happens one more time, I’m going to lose it."
2000012945,anger,"Took my time getting everything right, and now it’s all ruined. Furious."
2000012946,anger,"If one more thing goes wrong, I’m about to explode."
2000012947,anger,Can NOTHING go smoothly for once? Today has been a total joke.
2000012948,anger,"Just when I thought things were turning around, BAM—more problems."
2000012949,anger,This app crashes every time I need it. I’m about to throw my phone.
2000012950,anger,Spent hours on this project and it’s all gone. I. AM. DONE.
2000012951,anger,You’ve GOT to be kidding me. This day has been a non-stop disaster.
2000012952,anger,"Had one thing to look forward to, and it’s ruined. I’m LIVID."
2000012953,anger,Why is everything so difficult today?! I’m exhausted from being angry.
2000012954,anger,Sick of trying just for everything to go up in flames.
2000012955,anger,Spent money on express delivery and STILL waiting. What a waste!
2000012956,anger,"I’ve had it with delays, issues, and interruptions. Today’s a nightmare."
2000012957,anger,"If I have to deal with one more problem, I’m going to snap."
2000012958,anger,"Tried to enjoy my day, but it’s been ruined AGAIN."
2000012959,anger,Just put in all this effort for NOTHING. Absolutely infuriating.
2000012960,anger,Why does every little thing have to fight me today?!
2000012961,anger,"After all my prep, and this is the thanks I get. Ridiculous."
2000012962,anger,Nothing but one setback after another. This is unbearable.
2000012963,anger,Finally had plans and they’re canceled at the last minute. Again.
2000012964,anger,Is it so much to ask for ONE thing to go right today?
2000012965,anger,The amount of nonsense I’ve dealt with today is mind-blowing.
2000012966,anger,"This was supposed to be a good day, but NOPE—ruined."
2000012967,anger,"Paid extra, waited forever, and it’s still wrong. Seriously?!"
2000012968,anger,Nothing ever works out the way I plan it. Beyond fed up.
2000012969,anger,"Wanted peace and quiet, but it’s a circus here."
2000012970,anger,"Got my hopes up, and then life threw it back in my face."
2000012971,anger,Stuck in this mess because someone else screwed up.
2000012972,anger,"Was actually looking forward to today, and it’s ruined."
2000012973,anger,Why does everything have to go wrong when it matters most?
2000012974,anger,"Finally got free time, and now I’m fighting with tech issues."
2000012975,anger,"Wanted a smooth day, but nope—constant chaos."
2000012976,anger,"After all the work I put in, and it falls apart just like that."
2000012977,anger,Every single detail today has gone wrong. I’m ready to lose it.
2000012978,anger,"I’m over it. Nothing works, and it’s driving me insane."
2000012979,anger,You’ve got to be kidding me! How much worse can this day get?
2000012980,anger,"All I wanted was one thing to go right, and I can’t even get that."
2000012981,anger,Stuck dealing with everyone else’s mess. I’m beyond fed up.
2000012982,anger,"Was looking forward to today, but now it’s just disappointment."
2000012983,anger,"Thought I’d get a break, but this day has been relentless."
2000012984,anger,I’m about ready to throw in the towel on this entire day.
2000012985,anger,"Spent money on something special, and it’s garbage. Great."
2000012986,anger,"Wanted one day to go smoothly, but it’s been hell."
2000012987,anger,@username I can’t believe this! I’m so over it.
2000012988,anger,"I swear, nothing but problems today. About to lose my mind."
2000012989,anger,"Every time I think I’m done, something else goes wrong."
2000012990,anger,"Worked my butt off, and everything just fell apart. I’m furious."
2000012991,anger,Nothing like starting the day with a string of failures.
2000012992,anger,"Finally found time for this, and it’s ruined. Unbelievable."
2000012993,anger,What a complete and total disaster. Sick of it all.
2000012994,anger,Put in all this time and effort for NOTHING.
2000012995,anger,"Thought things would go right today, but it’s been pure chaos."
2000012996,anger,I have zero patience left. This day has been a nightmare.
2000012997,anger,Tired of trying when all I get is disappointment.
2000012998,anger,"Spent my day on this, and it’s a mess. So done."
2000012999,anger,Nothing but nonstop issues. I can’t handle this anymore.
2000013000,anger,"Just wanted one thing to go as planned, and it’s all wrong."
2000013001,anger,Sick of dealing with everyone else’s problems on my day off.
2000013002,anger,My patience is GONE. I can’t take this anymore.
2000013003,anger,Absolutely furious with how everything’s turned out today.
2000013004,anger,"Just wanted to relax, but no—it’s just issue after issue."
2000013005,anger,Put in the effort and still got nowhere. What a waste.
2000013006,anger,This day has been nothing but a total letdown.
2000013007,anger,The whole day has been ruined. I’m furious.
2000013008,anger,I don’t have the energy for this nonsense anymore.
2000013009,anger,"Spent so much time on this, and it’s just fallen apart."
2000013010,anger,Today has been a total nightmare from start to finish.
2000013011,anger,"Was finally going to enjoy myself, and everything’s gone wrong."
2000013012,anger,Beyond fed up with how every little thing is a disaster today.
2000013013,anger,"Had plans for a great day, but nothing is going right."
2000013014,anger,This whole situation is getting out of hand. I can’t believe this!
2000013015,anger,"How is it that every time I try to relax, something ruins it?!"
2000013016,anger,Sick of dealing with this nonsense every single day.
2000013017,anger,I’ve had enough! Every little thing is just making me angrier.
2000013018,anger,"Trying to get something done, but it's just one failure after another."
2000013019,anger,"I swear, if I get one more error message, I’m throwing this thing out the window."
2000013020,anger,"Every time I try, something always messes up. I’m DONE."
2000013021,anger,I can’t believe I wasted my time on this. What a waste of energy!
2000013022,anger,This is absurd. How can everything go so wrong all the time?
2000013023,anger,"Done with today! Nothing is going right, and I’m DONE dealing with it."
2000013024,anger,Everything I touch seems to fall apart. Is this real life?
2000013025,anger,"I just wanted ONE thing to go right, but no—of course not."
2000013026,anger,I’ve never been so frustrated in my life. This day is ridiculous.
2000013027,anger,"Trying to get through the day, but it’s just one obstacle after another."
2000013028,anger,"I’m absolutely livid. Everything is wrong, and nothing is working."
2000013029,anger,"Every time I think it can’t get worse, it does. I’m beyond angry."
2000013030,anger,So much for having a peaceful day. I’m done with this crap.
2000013031,anger,I’m fed up with dealing with the same issues over and over.
2000013032,anger,This is NOT how today was supposed to go. I’m pissed.
2000013033,anger,Why does it feel like the universe is against me today?
2000013034,anger,"I’m trying to focus, and it’s just one distraction after another."
2000013035,anger,"This is so frustrating, I can’t even put it into words anymore."
2000013036,anger,How is it possible for EVERYTHING to go wrong on the same day?
2000013037,anger,I hate this. I can’t deal with this stupidity anymore.
2000013038,anger,I’m beyond angry. I can’t believe I’m dealing with this again.
2000013039,anger,My patience is gone. I’m done with these constant problems.
2000013040,anger,I’ve had enough of these never-ending issues.
2000013041,anger,This is infuriating. I just want one thing to work out.
2000013042,anger,I’m losing my mind over here. Can’t believe this is happening.
2000013043,anger,I can’t stand this anymore! I’m seriously about to lose it.
2000013044,anger,"Everything is going wrong today, and I don’t know how much more I can take."
2000013045,anger,"Every single time I make plans, something messes it up."
2000013046,anger,I am DONE with all of this. This is not how I planned my day.
2000013047,anger,There’s no way this is happening right now. I’m beyond pissed off.
2000013048,anger,"I just want to get through today, but it’s impossible."
2000013049,anger,Why is everything so frustrating right now?!
2000013050,anger,I can’t stand this. I’m over it. Nothing is working out.
2000013051,anger,This is the most frustrating day I’ve had in a long time.
2000013052,anger,One thing after another is ruining my day. Enough is enough.
2000013053,anger,"I’ve spent hours on this, and it’s still not right. I’m furious."
2000013054,anger,I’m literally boiling with rage right now. Everything’s messed up.
2000013055,anger,My patience is wearing thin. This is beyond frustrating.
2000013056,anger,Sick of dealing with the same crap every single day.
2000013057,anger,I’m so tired of things going wrong. This is getting ridiculous.
2000013058,anger,This day can’t end fast enough. I’m done with everything.
2000013059,anger,Can’t believe this is happening AGAIN. I’m beyond angry.
2000013060,anger,"I’ve tried everything, and nothing is working. This is a nightmare."
2000013061,anger,Done with this. I’m done with today. Nothing’s going the way it should.
2000013062,anger,"I don’t know why I even try. Every time I do, it backfires."
2000013063,anger,I’m fed up with this never-ending cycle of disappointment.
2000013064,anger,Nothing is going right. I’m seriously so mad right now.
2000013065,anger,This is absolutely infuriating. I need a break from all of this.
2000013066,anger,Why does everything keep going wrong? This is insane.
2000013067,anger,I’ve had enough of all these roadblocks. I’m seriously losing it.
2000013068,anger,This is a nightmare. I just want one thing to go right.
2000013069,anger,I can’t believe I’m dealing with this. I’m done.
2000013070,anger,I can’t take this anymore. Everything’s falling apart.
2000013071,anger,I hate this. I just want a break from all the problems.
2000013072,anger,This situation is beyond frustrating. Nothing ever goes right.
2000013073,anger,I don’t even want to deal with this anymore. It’s too much.
2000013074,anger,This day is completely ruined. I’m so angry I can’t think straight.
2000013075,anger,What’s the point of trying when everything just falls apart?
2000013076,anger,How do I always end up dealing with this crap? I’m so angry.
2000013077,anger,"Everything that could go wrong today, did. So pissed off."
2000013078,anger,I’m done with these issues. I can’t handle this anymore.
2000013079,anger,I am absolutely sick of this. Can’t catch a break.
2000013080,anger,"Trying to stay calm, but this is pushing me to my limit."
2000013081,anger,"All I wanted was a peaceful day, and this is what I get."
2000013082,anger,I am so done with dealing with everything going wrong.
2000013083,anger,I’m at my breaking point. This day is a total disaster.
2000013084,anger,"I can’t believe this is happening again. Seriously, why does this always happen to me?"
2000013085,anger,Enough is enough. I’ve had it with this nonsense!
2000013086,anger,I’ve been patient long enough. This is ridiculous!
2000013087,anger,This is the worst thing that could’ve happened today.
2000013088,anger,"I swear, I’m this close to losing it."
2000013089,anger,How do things keep going so wrong? This is so frustrating.
2000013090,anger,Why does every single thing I try today fail?
2000013091,anger,I am SO DONE with dealing with this. It’s not even funny anymore.
2000013092,anger,I’ve been dealing with this for hours. Just fix it already!
2000013093,anger,I’m beyond annoyed. This is a total waste of my time.
2000013094,anger,This whole situation is making my blood boil.
2000013095,anger,Can’t even have a good day without everything falling apart.
2000013096,anger,"Every time I think I’m done, I find more problems."
2000013097,anger,I’m done waiting for this to get fixed. I’m furious.
2000013098,anger,"Nothing is ever simple, and I can’t stand it anymore."
2000013099,anger,How many times do I have to deal with this? I'm at my breaking point.
2000013100,anger,This is absolutely infuriating. I don’t know how much longer I can handle it.
2000013101,anger,Everything I’m doing today is a complete disaster.
2000013102,anger,I literally cannot believe this. Why is this happening to me?
2000013103,anger,At my wit’s end right now. This is completely unacceptable.
2000013104,anger,I should’ve known this would happen. I’m beyond frustrated.
2000013105,anger,I’m over it. I’m done. This is so aggravating.
2000013106,anger,Everything I do keeps backfiring. This is beyond frustrating.
2000013107,anger,Why does everything I touch break today? I’m seriously pissed.
2000013108,anger,I can’t even catch a break today. It’s driving me mad.
2000013109,anger,"Everything that could go wrong today, HAS. So over it."
2000013110,anger,"I don’t care how minor this is, it’s just another thing on the pile of BS today."
2000013111,anger,How am I supposed to get anything done when nothing is working?
2000013112,anger,Sick of all the constant setbacks today. I’m really done with this.
2000013113,anger,I’ve been trying to fix this for HOURS. Nothing is changing.
2000013114,anger,This is not how today was supposed to go. I’m furious.
2000013115,anger,I just want one thing to work today. Is that too much to ask?
2000013116,anger,You’ve got to be kidding me! I can’t take any more of this.
2000013117,anger,I’m SO angry I can’t even put it into words right now.
2000013118,anger,What is with today? Everything is going wrong and I’m losing it.
2000013119,anger,Can’t even finish one task without something ruining it.
2000013120,anger,All this effort for nothing. It’s ridiculous!
2000013121,anger,The universe must have a personal vendetta against me today.
2000013122,anger,This is exactly why I hate waiting. Wasting my entire day.

2000014279,anger,I can’t even get through one task without more issues.
2000014280,anger,I’m losing my mind. Why can’t anything go right today?
2000014281,anger,This is beyond frustrating. I need a break from all these problems!
2000014282,anger,Why is it always something else? Can’t I just finish one thing?
2000014283,anger,I’ve had enough. This is too much to handle.
2000014284,anger,This is the worst. Why is everything going wrong today?
2000014285,anger,"@someone, why do you always make things ten times harder than they need to be? It’s maddening!"

2000014297,anger,"How many more times will I have to fix the same problem, @someone? This is insane!"
2000014298,anger,"@someone, I can’t even imagine how this could have gone wrong, but somehow, it did."
2000014299,anger,@anotheruser I swear this is the most frustrating thing I’ve ever had to deal with!
2000014300,anger,I’m losing my mind over here @someone. Every step forward just leads to two steps back.

2000014310,anger,@anotheruser I feel like I’m banging my head against a wall. How can nothing go right?
2000014311,anger,I can’t take this anymore @someone. Why do I have to deal with this same issue over and over?
2000014312,anger,This is beyond frustrating @someone. How is everything breaking down at once?
2000014313,anger,"@someone, I’m not sure how much more of this I can handle. It’s just too much!"

2000014324,anger,This is absolutely ridiculous @someone. Why does it feel like nothing works when I need it most?
2000014325,anger,"How does every little thing become a big problem, @someone? I’m done!"
2000014326,anger,"@someone, why can’t anything just go smoothly for once?"
2000014327,anger,"I can’t even handle how bad this is, @someone. Everything is a disaster!"

2000014444,anger,"@someone, why can’t anything just go smoothly? I’m beyond done with this."
2000014445,anger,"I’m losing my patience with all of this, @someone. Why does everything always go wrong?"
2000014446,anger,"@someone, I’m at my breaking point. Everything is falling apart today."
2000014447,anger,"@anotheruser, I can’t even begin to deal with this mess. It’s beyond repair!"
2000014448,anger,This is ridiculous @someone. I can’t catch a break today!
2000014449,anger,I’ve had enough @someone. Why do I keep fixing other people’s mistakes?
2000014450,anger,"@someone, I’m seriously so done. This is way too much to handle right now."
2000014451,anger,"@anotheruser, why does everything always seem to fall apart when I need it the most?"
2000014452,anger,This is insane @someone. I can’t get anything done today!
2000014453,anger,"How is everything going wrong today, @someone? This is getting out of hand!"
2000014454,anger,I’m done trying to fix this @someone. Everything just keeps breaking!
2000014455,anger,"@anotheruser, why can’t anyone just do their job properly? This is driving me insane!"

2000014512,anger,I can’t take it anymore @someone. I’ve had enough of this mess!
2000014513,anger,"@anotheruser, how do you keep making everything harder than it needs to be?"
2000014514,anger,"@someone, I can’t even get through one task without another problem."

2000014516,anger,"@anotheruser, I’m losing it. Everything is falling apart today!"
2000014517,anger,I can’t believe this is happening again @someone. This is just too much!
2000014518,anger,"@someone, nothing works today. I can’t even catch a break."
2000014519,anger,"@anotheruser, this is just ridiculous. How is it that everything is going wrong at once?"
2000014520,anger,"@someone, seriously, how do you mess this up every single time? It’s beyond me."
2000014521,anger,"I can't believe how many times I've had to fix this, @someone. I’m DONE!"
2000014522,anger,"@anotheruser, this is ridiculous. How does everything fall apart at once?"
2000014523,anger,"@someone, I’ve had enough. Why does it feel like everything is going wrong today?"
2000014524,anger,"@anotheruser, every single time I try, something else breaks. This is impossible!"

2000014530,anger,"I can’t even catch a break today, @someone. This is madness!"
2000014531,anger,"@someone, this is a joke! How does everything break when I need it the most?"
2000014532,anger,"@anotheruser, I’m losing it. Nothing ever goes right for me!"
2000014533,anger,"I’m so over this @someone. Every time I think I’ve fixed one problem, another pops up!"
2000014534,anger,"Why does everything seem to go wrong when I need it most, @someone?"
2000014535,anger,I’m about to lose my mind @someone. This is beyond frustrating!
2000014536,anger,"@someone, I can't even focus today because everything keeps going wrong."

2000014544,anger,"@someone, how is it possible for everything to go wrong at once? It’s infuriating!"
2000014545,anger,"@anotheruser, I can't take this anymore. Everything is falling apart!"
2000014546,anger,"@someone, nothing works today. Why is this happening?"
2000014547,anger,"I can't even get through the day without facing more problems, @someone."
2000014548,anger,"@someone, why does it always feel like I’m cleaning up other people’s messes?"
2000014549,anger,I’m so fed up with this situation @someone. Why is everything going wrong?
2000014550,anger,"@anotheruser, how is it that nothing ever works out when I need it?"
2000014551,anger,"I swear, @someone, this is the worst day ever. Everything is failing."
2000014552,anger,"@someone, I’m losing my patience with this. It’s beyond frustrating!"

2000014599,anger,"@someone, I’ve had it with all these endless assignments. How am I supposed to keep up?"
2000014600,anger,I can’t believe this exam schedule @university. Why does everything overlap?
2000014601,anger,"@professor, seriously? Another assignment on top of everything else? You’ve got to be kidding me!"
2000014602,anger,"@someone, I don’t get how professors expect us to finish all these papers in such a short time. This is insane!"
2000014603,anger,"@university, why are my grades still not updated? This is getting ridiculous."
2000014604,anger,"I’ve had enough of this, @someone. Why do all these group projects feel like I’m doing all the work?"
2000014605,anger,"@professor, I spent hours on this paper and you give me a D? You’re kidding, right?"
2000014606,anger,"@someone, I’m so done with all these last-minute changes to our class schedules. This is not okay!"
2000014607,anger,I’m seriously about to lose it @university. Why does every class have deadlines in the same week?
2000014608,anger,"@someone, I can’t believe I’m getting penalized for things outside of my control. This is so unfair!"
2000014609,anger,I’ve had it with the constant technical issues in class @university. Why can’t anything ever work smoothly?
2000014610,anger,"@someone, seriously? Another pop quiz after we already had an exam? This is too much."
2000014611,anger,"@professor, you’re making us redo an entire project over one minor mistake? This is insane!"
2000014612,anger,"@university, why is it so hard to get a response about financial aid? I’m losing my mind over here!"
2000014613,anger,"@someone, I can’t even think straight with all these assignments piling up. I’m done!"
2000014614,anger,"How is it that every time I finish one thing, @university, ten more things pop up?"
2000014615,anger,"@someone, this course is a nightmare. Why is the workload so ridiculous?"
2000014616,anger,"@university, why do you keep changing deadlines at the last minute? It’s beyond frustrating!"
2000014617,anger,"@someone, I’m so done with working in groups. Why do I always end up doing everything myself?"
2000014618,anger,"@professor, I can’t believe you just added another exam. We’re already overwhelmed!"
2000014619,anger,"@university, why does it always take forever to get anything done around here?"
2000014620,anger,"@someone, I swear, every class has too much work, and none of it is even relevant."
2000014621,anger,I can’t even focus anymore @university. The stress is driving me crazy!
2000014622,anger,"@someone, can someone please explain why every single paper has the same due date?"
2000014623,anger,"@professor, I need a break! Another test in the same week? Are you serious?"
2000014624,anger,"@someone, why is the workload in university always so unbearable?"
2000014625,anger,I can’t even breathe with all this work piling up @university. It’s like you don’t care.
2000014626,anger,"@someone, I literally just finished one assignment and here comes another one. I’m done!"
2000014627,anger,"Why are the exams so difficult this year, @university? This is ridiculous!"
2000014628,anger,"@someone, I’m so fed up with these never-ending group projects. Why do I always end up doing everything?"
2000014629,anger,How does @university expect us to stay sane with this insane workload?
2000014630,anger,"@someone, I swear, nothing ever works out. I have a million things to do and no time to do them."
2000014631,anger,"@professor, you just gave us a 30-minute notice for a test? Are you out of your mind?"
2000014632,anger,"@university, how is it that your system crashes every time I try to submit my assignments?"
2000014633,anger,"@someone, I’m so tired of trying to balance everything. College is becoming unbearable."
2000014634,anger,"Why do you keep adding more requirements, @university? I can’t keep up!"
2000014635,anger,"@someone, I have zero motivation left. How do you expect me to do all of this?"
2000014636,anger,I’m losing my mind @university. You can’t keep piling more and more on us!
2000014637,anger,"@someone, why do you keep changing the syllabus halfway through the semester? It’s so frustrating!"
2000014638,anger,"@professor, I don’t even know what you want anymore. This is getting out of hand!"
2000014639,anger,"I’ve had enough of working in the library, @someone. It’s so quiet and stressful!"
2000014640,anger,Why is it so hard to get a clear answer from @university? I’m so over it!
2000014641,anger,"@someone, can I just get a break already? Why is everything so overwhelming?"
2000014642,anger,"@university, I don’t even know how I’m going to finish everything. This is too much!"
2000014643,anger,"@someone, why do we always have to redo assignments because of vague instructions?"
2000014644,anger,"I’m done with this, @university. Why do you have to make everything so complicated?"
2000014645,anger,"@someone, I can’t handle all these assignments. How are we supposed to do all of this?"
2000014646,anger,"@university, why do your systems always break down at the worst possible moments?"
2000014647,anger,"@someone, I don’t even know what to study for this test. This is ridiculous!"
2000014648,anger,"@professor, I’m seriously frustrated. Another quiz when we just had an exam?"
2000014649,anger,"@someone, how are we supposed to handle this kind of workload? I’m so over it!"
2000014650,anger,"I swear @university, nothing is ever organized here. It’s driving me insane!"
2000014651,anger,"@someone, why does everything always go wrong when I need it to go right?"
2000014652,anger,"@university, how do you expect us to focus with all this stress?"
2000014653,anger,"@someone, seriously? Another meeting when I already have ten other things to do?"
2000014654,anger,"@professor, how does this exam have so many questions? This is not fair!"
2000014655,anger,"@university, I’m done. Why is everything so chaotic?"
2000014656,anger,"@someone, how many times do I have to ask for a response? I’m not waiting any longer!"
2000014657,anger,"@professor, I don’t know how you expect us to complete all these papers in a week."
2000014658,anger,"@someone, I’m about to lose it. Every time I try to get ahead, I fall behind!"
2000014659,anger,"@university, this entire semester has been a nightmare. I just want it to be over!"
2000014660,anger,"@someone, I can’t even get through the day without some new issue popping up."
2000014661,anger,"@professor, I am not okay with having no time to prepare for this exam!"
2000014662,anger,"@someone, why do I always have to work around everyone else’s mistakes? This is exhausting!"
2000014663,anger,"@university, can you please fix your system? I’ve been trying to submit my paper for hours!"
2000014664,anger,"I’m so done with everything, @someone. College is just too much!"
2000014665,anger,"@someone, I’m literally drowning in work right now. When will it stop?"
2000014666,anger,"@professor, are you serious with these grading standards? This is impossible!"
2000014667,anger,"@someone, I can’t believe this. Why does everything have to be so hard?"
2000014668,anger,"@university, I swear if I fail this semester because of all these mistakes, I’m done!"

2000015111,anger,"@someone, why is it so hard to get proper data for research? This is seriously frustrating."
2000015112,anger,"@someone, I’m so done with these constant setbacks. How does anyone finish research with all these obstacles?"

2000015125,anger,"@someone, every time I try to use a coupon, it never works. Why even have them if they don’t apply?"

2000015191,anger,"@someone, I’m done trying to get my money back. This store is a scam."
2000015192,anger,"@someone, this place doesn’t deserve my business. I’m so angry at how they’ve handled my order."
2000015193,anger,"@someone, I can’t even return this item properly. This store is a nightmare to deal with."
2000015194,anger,"@someone, I’m beyond angry right now. They keep sending me the wrong items!"
2000015195,anger,"@someone, this store doesn’t care about its customers at all. I’m so frustrated."

2000015198,anger,"@someone, it’s almost like they don’t even care about their customers. Every experience is a disaster."
2000015199,anger,"@someone, I’m done. This store has caused me enough stress."
2000015200,anger,"@someone, the fact that I have to jump through hoops just to return something is absurd."
2000015201,anger,"@someone, I can’t believe how exhausting parenting is. I haven’t had a moment to myself in days."
2000015202,anger,"@someone, why is it that every time I make plans, my kid gets sick? This is so frustrating."
2000015203,anger,"@someone, why does parenting have to be so complicated? I feel like I’m failing every day."
2000015204,anger,"@someone, I’ve had enough! Can’t even take a nap without my kids interrupting me."
2000015205,anger,"@someone, how does my child have so much energy? I’m about to lose my mind."
2000015206,anger,"@someone, seriously? My toddler has been throwing tantrums all day. I’m losing it!"
2000015207,anger,"@someone, how does everything I do for my kid end up being wrong? Nothing seems to work."
2000015208,anger,"@someone, I’m so over cleaning up messes all day. It’s like a never-ending cycle."
2000015209,anger,"@someone, I can't even have five minutes to myself. Parenting is draining."
2000015210,anger,"@someone, why do kids always ask for things when you’re busy doing something important?"
2000015211,anger,"@someone, I love my kids, but today has been one of those days where I just want to scream."
2000015212,anger,"@someone, can’t believe my kid refused to eat their dinner AGAIN. What do I have to do to get them to eat?"
2000015213,anger,"@someone, I don’t understand how my child can be so loud all the time. It’s driving me crazy."
2000015214,anger,"@someone, I’m so over the constant chaos. Parenting feels like a full-time job with no break."
2000015215,anger,"@someone, why does bedtime have to be such a battle every night? I just want some peace."
2000015216,anger,"@someone, I’m done. Parenting today has been a nightmare. Nothing is going right."
2000015217,anger,"@someone, I can't believe how much patience I’ve lost after today. I need a break!"

2000015219,anger,"@someone, I really need some time off. Parenting is driving me nuts."
2000015220,anger,"@someone, I’m so tired of repeating myself all day. Can they just listen for once?"
2000015221,anger,"@someone, my child just threw another tantrum over the smallest thing. I can't take it anymore."
2000015222,anger,"@someone, how does my child manage to make everything difficult? I need a break!"
2000015223,anger,"@someone, I can’t handle the whining anymore. It’s like no matter what I do, they’re never satisfied."
2000015224,anger,"@someone, I'm ready to lose it. My kid has been testing every last nerve today."
2000015225,anger,"@someone, how do I get my kid to stop pushing my buttons? I’m getting so fed up."
2000015226,anger,"@someone, why does every day feel like a struggle? Parenting is harder than I ever imagined."
2000015227,anger,"@someone, I am so exhausted. I can barely keep up with all of the demands of parenthood."
2000015228,anger,"@someone, every time I think I’ve got parenting figured out, something goes wrong."
2000015229,anger,"@someone, I can't believe how hard it is to find time for myself as a parent. It’s like I don’t exist anymore."
2000015230,anger,"@someone, how is it that every time I clean, my kid finds a way to make a bigger mess?"
2000015231,anger,"@someone, I can't believe my kid refuses to go to bed at a decent hour again."
2000015232,anger,"@someone, parenting feels like I’m constantly on edge. I need a break, like yesterday!"
2000015233,anger,"@someone, how do I get my child to stop arguing with everything I say? I’m done with this."
2000015234,anger,"@someone, today was the kind of day where I just wanted to hide in the bathroom for five minutes of silence."
2000015235,anger,"@someone, my kid’s behavior is really pushing me to my limits today. I need some space!"
2000015236,anger,"@someone, I can’t keep up with the never-ending mess. Parenting is exhausting."
2000015237,anger,"@someone, why does it feel like I’m the only one trying in this parenting situation?"
2000015238,anger,"@someone, how do you get through a day without feeling totally burned out as a parent?"
2000015239,anger,"@someone, seriously, can my kid just listen for once? I’m over this constant battle."
2000015240,anger,"@someone, it's like my child knows exactly how to push my buttons. I am losing my patience."
2000015241,anger,"@someone, parenting has been way harder than I thought. Why is it so difficult to just get a little peace?"
2000015242,anger,"@someone, I am done with today. I’ve had enough of the tantrums and messes."
2000015243,anger,"@someone, my kid just won’t listen no matter what I do. I feel like I'm losing my mind."
2000015244,anger,"@someone, why do kids have to be so difficult? I can’t keep up with this constant chaos."
2000015245,anger,"@someone, I’m so frustrated with the constant mess my kids leave everywhere. I just want a clean house for once."
2000015246,anger,"@someone, I’ve had it. I can’t keep doing this every day. Parenting is way harder than I thought."
2000015247,anger,"@someone, how does a simple task like getting dressed turn into such a battle with my kid?"
2000015248,anger,"@someone, I feel like I’ve been saying the same thing over and over again all day. Is anyone listening?"
2000015249,anger,"@someone, I’m seriously at my breaking point. Parenting is draining me."
2000015250,anger,"@someone, every time I think my kid is starting to listen, they prove me wrong. I’m over it."
2000015251,anger,"@someone, I swear, my child has mastered the art of pushing my buttons. I can’t take it anymore."
2000015252,anger,"@someone, I just need a day without screaming, tantrums, or meltdowns. Is that too much to ask?"
2000015253,anger,"@someone, I’m really fed up with my kid's attitude today. Why do they have to argue about everything?"
2000015254,anger,"@someone, it’s like no matter what I do, my kid is always unhappy. Why is parenting this hard?"
2000015255,anger,"@someone, I just want five minutes to myself without having to deal with tantrums."
2000015256,anger,"@someone, I can't even enjoy a meal without my kid whining about something. I’m over it."
2000015257,anger,"@someone, I'm done. Parenting is supposed to be rewarding, but today just feels like a never-ending battle."
2000015258,anger,"@someone, I’m losing my patience. How do I get my child to understand that no means no?"
2000015259,anger,"@someone, I just spent the whole day trying to calm my kid down, and now I’m the one who needs a break."
2000015260,anger,"@someone, my kid is making everything so difficult today. I’m so frustrated."
2000015261,anger,"@someone, is it just me, or does parenting sometimes feel like the hardest job in the world?"
2000015262,anger,"@someone, I need a break from the constant demands of parenthood. This is too much!"
2000015263,anger,"@someone, I’m done. Can I just get five minutes of peace and quiet, please?"
2000015264,anger,"@someone, I can’t keep up with all the messes and chaos today. Parenting is wearing me out."
2000015265,anger,"@someone, it’s like my kid’s goal today is to drive me absolutely insane."
2000015266,anger,"@someone, how do I make it through a day of constant screaming and tantrums without losing my mind?"
2000015267,anger,"@someone, my kid’s attitude today is unbearable. I can’t stand the whining anymore."
2000015268,anger,"@someone, I am so tired of having to constantly remind my kid to do the simplest things."
2000015269,anger,"@someone, I just want a break from being a parent. Everything is so overwhelming right now."
2000015270,anger,"@someone, why is parenting so exhausting? I haven’t had a break in forever."
2000015271,anger,"@someone, I swear, every time I get one task done, another one pops up. Parenthood is relentless."
2000015272,anger,"@someone, I feel like my kid is constantly testing my patience. I’m running on empty."
2000015273,anger,"@someone, I really need a break from the chaos. Parenthood is wearing me thin."
2000015274,anger,"@someone, can’t believe I have to say “please” for the hundredth time today. Parenting is exhausting."
2000015275,anger,"@someone, why does it feel like my kid doesn’t listen to me no matter how many times I say something?"
2000015276,anger,"@someone, the tantrums are never-ending. I can’t deal with this much longer."
2000015277,anger,"@someone, I just want a day off. Is that too much to ask?"
2000015278,anger,"@someone, my kid has been impossible to deal with today. I'm at my wit's end."
2000015279,anger,"@someone, I really need some help. Parenting is too much to handle alone."
2000015280,anger,"@someone, I’m exhausted. I can’t keep up with all the demands of being a parent"
2000015281,anger,"@someone, seriously? This is the third time this week my order has been wrong. Can’t take it anymore."
2000015282,anger,"@someone, how does everything go wrong the minute I try to relax?"
2000015283,anger,"@someone, I’m so over it. Another delay and I’m losing my mind."
2000015284,anger,"@someone, every time I try to leave, something holds me back. Why does this always happen?"
2000015285,anger,"@someone, I’m done! I can’t stand this nonsense anymore."
2000015286,anger,"@someone, that’s it. I’m over this and done trying."

2000015288,anger,"@someone, wow, I can’t believe this. How is this even possible?"
2000015289,anger,"@someone, I can’t even handle this anymore. So much for a relaxing day."
2000015290,anger,"@someone, why does everything keep going wrong today?"
2000015291,anger,"@someone, I’ve had enough. Why do these things always happen at the worst times?"
2000015292,anger,"@someone, I swear, the world is just out to get me today."
2000015293,anger,"@someone, so tired of this. I just need a break from all the chaos."
2000015294,anger,"@someone, I don’t understand why nothing ever works out the way I want it to."
2000015295,anger,"@someone, I’m so tired of this back-and-forth. Can’t we just get things right already?"
2000015296,anger,"@someone, this is ridiculous. I can’t believe this is happening again."
2000015297,anger,"@someone, I’m done. I’m literally about to snap."
2000015298,anger,"@someone, I can’t believe how much this is stressing me out."
2000015299,anger,"@someone, this is literally the worst day I’ve had in a while."
2000015300,anger,"@someone, why can’t I just catch a break? Everything is just falling apart."
2000015301,anger,"@someone, I’m honestly about to lose it. Nothing is going right today."
2000015302,anger,"@someone, I can’t deal with this anymore. I need a break from all of this."
2000015303,anger,"@someone, I don’t care what anyone says. This is unacceptable."
2000015304,anger,"@someone, I’m so done with trying. This is just way too much."
2000015305,anger,"@someone, this is beyond frustrating. I can’t even."
2000015306,anger,"@someone, I’ve tried, but I just can’t keep going with this."
2000015307,anger,"@someone, another day, another problem. I’m over it."
2000015308,anger,"@someone, how do I fix this mess? Because right now, I’m losing my patience."

2000015311,anger,"@someone, I can’t even explain how mad I am right now."
2000015312,anger,"@someone, this has got to be the most annoying thing ever."
2000015313,anger,"@someone, I’m seriously done with all the nonsense today."
2000015314,anger,"@someone, what a joke. I don’t even know why I bother."
2000015315,anger,"@someone, can everything just stop going wrong for once?"
2000015316,anger,"@someone, it’s one thing after another. Can’t catch a break today."
2000015317,anger,"@someone, this is insane. I can’t deal with this right now."
2000015318,anger,"@someone, I’m done. I’m seriously done."
2000015319,anger,"@someone, I can’t even think straight anymore with all this nonsense."
2000015320,anger,"@someone, if one more thing goes wrong today, I’m done."
2000015321,anger,"@someone, just stop. I’m over it already."
2000015322,anger,"@someone, I’m losing it. This day just keeps getting worse."
2000015323,anger,"@someone, I swear this is the worst day ever. Nothing is going my way."

2000015396,anger,"@someone, I don’t care what anyone says, the latest plot twist was garbage."

2000015399,anger,"@someone, can they stop with the filler episodes? Just get to the good stuff already!"
2000015400,anger,"@someone, I’m done with this series. Every episode feels like a waste of time now."
2000015401,anger,"@someone, the latest season is nothing like the first. It’s ruining everything I loved about the show."
2000015402,anger,"@someone, how did they mess up the finale so badly? I’m beyond disappointed."
2000015403,anger,"@someone, if one more character does something stupid, I’m done. I can’t keep watching this nonsense."

2000015407,anger,"@someone, I’m so mad! Why did they ruin such a perfect storyline with that ridiculous plot twist?"
2000015408,anger,"@someone, this series should’ve ended seasons ago. What are they even doing at this point?"
2000015409,anger,"@someone, I can’t believe they wasted an entire season on pointless filler. I’m livid!"
2000015410,anger,"@someone, it’s like they don’t even care about the fans anymore. This series is a joke now."
2000015411,anger,"@someone, this show started out so great, but now I’m just angry every time I watch it."
2000015412,anger,"@someone, I don’t even recognize the characters anymore. They’ve changed so much and it’s pissing me off."
2000015413,anger,"@someone, I’m not sure how much more of this series I can take. It’s getting harder to watch."
2000015414,anger,"@someone, they’ve completely lost me. I’m done with this show for good."
2000015415,anger,"@someone, why do they keep ruining the best characters? It’s making me so mad!"
2000015416,anger,"@someone, I’ve wasted hours watching this, and now I feel like I’ve just been let down."
2000015417,anger,"@someone, I can’t believe they’re going to end the series like this. What a joke."
2000015418,anger,"@someone, if this is how the show is going to go, I’m done. This is not worth my time anymore."
2000015419,anger,"@someone, I’m so over this series. I can’t stand the way they’re handling the storyline."
2000015420,anger,"@someone, this is the worst season by far. What happened to the good writing?"
2000015421,anger,"@someone, I’m so angry at how they’re treating this show’s legacy. It’s such a disappointment."
2000015422,anger,"@someone, I’m so done with this series. Why is every season worse than the last?"
2000015423,anger,"@someone, if they mess up one more season finale like this, I’m done watching for good."
2000015424,anger,"@someone, why do they keep introducing new characters no one cares about? I’m annoyed."
2000015425,anger,"@someone, the cliffhanger ending was ridiculous. I’m seriously upset they left us like that."
2000015426,anger,"@someone, this show had so much potential, and now I just want to forget it ever existed."
2000015427,anger,"@someone, I’ve never been so frustrated with a show. Can’t they just wrap things up already?"
