# Classifying Emotion in Tweets with Deep Learning

This is our data science project that utilizes deep learning techniques to classify emotions expressed in tweets.

## Requirements

- Access to Google Colab
- GPU Runtime
- High-speed internet connection

## Required Files

Ensure these files are present in the same directory as your Colab notebook:

- `tweet_emotions.csv` – Original tweets dataset
- `SynthesisedTweets.csv` – Synthetic tweets generated to balance classes

## Instructions to Run the Project

1. Open the Colab notebook:

   - [`Classifying Emotion in Tweets with Deep Learning.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15ftGs3xaA0BidDtmNa2L1JjW6Qanvn2G?usp=sharing)

2. Upload the required CSV files (`tweet_emotions.csv` and `SynthesisedTweets.csv`) into the notebook’s working directory.

3. Execute each cell sequentially from top to bottom, following the notebook instructions.

4. After completing all steps, you should obtain results matching those presented in our paper

## Important Note

- Model training is time-intensive. Enable GPU acceleration in Colab runtime settings to significantly speed up the process.
